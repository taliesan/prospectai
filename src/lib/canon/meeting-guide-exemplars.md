# MEETING GUIDE — KARA SWISHER

*Democracy Takes Work · February 2026 · Internal Use Only*

---

## THE DONOR READ

**POSTURE**

**She will interview you before you interview her. That's the opening, not the obstacle.**
Arrive with something she hasn't heard framed this way. If you survive three minutes without flinching, she'll decide you're worth the full meeting. She moves fast, interrupts, and makes declarations — match her pace or get left behind. Bring a shared contact if you have one — it makes her less likely to default to interview mode and more likely to show up as herself.

**WHAT LIGHTS THEM UP**

- **Name a structural problem in a system she already suspects is broken.**
  The more specific and unflattering the diagnosis, the more she trusts it. She stops testing and starts building.
- **Demonstrate field knowledge, not talking points.**
  Competence is her love language. Operational detail shifts her from prosecutorial to collaborative. She respects people who prepare for her the way she prepares for her subjects.
- **Give her information she can't get elsewhere.**
  Information is her ultimate resource. Her durable relationships are with people who give her access to worlds she doesn't have other windows into. DTW's deepest currency with her isn't a giving opportunity — it's a source relationship. Worker organizing in tech, from the inside.
- **Show her something genuinely novel about how organizing works.**
  After thirty years of overpromising tech, she still gets excited by real innovation. EWOC's model, digital-first campaigns, AI-era labor strategy — she'll respond to the novelty itself, not just its politics. She was early to the internet for the same reason.

**WHAT SHUTS THEM DOWN**

- **Flattery or organizational accomplishments up front. She's been licked up and down by billionaires. She'll classify you as a pitch.**
- **Hedging or shading the truth, even slightly. She places truth-telling above all relationships — she reported her own mentee to editors. The fundraiser who hedges loses her permanently.**
- **Treating her as a media figure, not a strategic thinker. You'll get the entertaining Kara — anecdotes, not commitment.**
- **Showing up unprepared. She'll collapse the meeting in five minutes.**

---

**THEY'LL READ YOU AS** · A nonprofit person asking for money. You have 90 seconds to establish you're a strategist running an outsider operation — not a cause with a brochure, not establishment philanthropy with a labor theme. She built her entire career as the outsider inside the system. She trusts people who operate from outside the way she does.

**AUTHORSHIP THEY NEED** · Intellectual and connective, with a patron gear. She doesn't want to design your strategy — she wants to see the gap and tell you who should be in the room. But if she decides you're worth investing in, she shifts from prosecutor to champion — and the bar goes up, not down. Follow through on every introduction, every suggestion. If she connects you to someone and you don't follow up within 48 hours, the relationship cools fast.

**IF THIS COLLAPSES TO 5 MIN:** *Land one insight about worker organizing in tech from the inside — not from a report. Position DTW as an information source she doesn't currently have. Get agreement to a longer conversation. Not the ask — the next meeting.*

---

## THE ALIGNMENT MAP

**PRIMARY TERRITORY**

**She's spent thirty years documenting how tech companies accumulate power without accountability. DTW's thesis is the structural answer to the story she's already telling.**
Workers organizing at Amazon, in tech, in AI-adjacent industries are the same people whose exploitation she covers. She just hasn't seen them as a portfolio — or had a source inside the organizing itself. The bridge: this isn't charity — it's the institutional counterweight to the problem she narrates. And DTW can give her a window she can't get from her existing networks.

**SECONDARY TERRITORIES**

- **Innovation that actually works.**
  EWOC, worker-led organizing, sectoral bargaining workarounds, AI-era labor models. New approaches to an old problem — she responds to genuine novelty the way she responded to early internet coverage. If she asks 'what's actually different,' this is where you go.
- **Outsider operation, not establishment philanthropy.**
  DTW funds insurgent organizing that legacy institutions can't or won't touch. She built her career doing what institutions wouldn't. If DTW reads as scrappy, strategic, and willing to fail — that's identity alignment, not just issue alignment.
- **Authoritarianism as a live threat.**
  Worker power as democratic infrastructure maps onto her post-Musk political awakening. She has a personal relationship with institutional exclusion deeper than her professional identity — closed doors, constrained paths, power over people who didn't get a vote. If she goes there, follow her.

**FIGHT OR BUILD** · **Open Fight.** She's a prosecutor. Lead with what's broken. But when she asks 'so what do you do about it,' pivot to Build. Let her pull you into the constructive frame. She'll trust it more if she demanded it.

**HANDS ON THE WHEEL** · **Connector, amplifier, and source consumer.** She doesn't want a board seat. She wants to know who you need to reach, whether she can make a call, and what's happening in your world that she should know about. The ongoing relationship is informational as much as financial — she invests in people who keep giving her things worth knowing.

## THE MEETING ARC

*The meeting starts before you sit down — she's reading you from the moment you walk in. Use the small talk naturally. Don't open with your material. She'll set the pace — let her. You're not taking turns — you're picking up threads from what she says and steering from inside her material. If time gets short, skip content to protect the arc. If you brought anything physical, it's a prop — the conversation is the meeting.*

| THE MOVE | THE READ |
|----------|----------|
| **1 · GET THEM TALKING** | |
| **Ask what they're seeing right now — in their space, not yours. What's happening in tech that worries them? Let them answer with a thesis.** | If they turn it back with a question that interrogates *you* — your credibility, your angle — that's not hostility. It's her deciding whether you're worth the investment. Stay. If she starts riffing — following an unexpected thread, making connections out loud in real time — that's her highest engagement mode. She's not just present. She's learning live. Don't interrupt that. |
| **2 · LET THEM NAME THE STAKES** | |
| **Ask what happens to working people inside these systems over the next five years. Don't frame it. Don't say 'worker power.' Let them arrive at the stakes in their own language. Then wait. Don't fill the silence.** | Whatever words they use — 'they're fucked,' 'nobody's looking out for them' — those are your vocabulary for the rest of the conversation. If she gets genuinely angry — not performing anger but real heat — that's the moment of highest conviction. Don't manage it. Don't redirect. Anger channeled into action is her most authentic register. Follow it. |
| **3 · COMBINE YOUR WORLDS** | |
| **Bridge from her framing — credit her language visibly when you connect it to the work. Then the tension: 'That's exactly the hole we're trying to fill — but here's what's hard.' Put a real strategic challenge on the table. Share what's failed and why. When she pokes holes, don't defend. Say 'That's the part we haven't solved.' As the shared picture builds, name what it's going to take: expertise, partners, resources. Make money part of the landscape, not a separate conversation.** | If she starts solving the problem, she's inside the frame. Stop talking. If she's co-creating — mapping connections, redesigning your approach — make it tangible. Capture it together on paper, on a napkin, on anything between you. Shared artifacts build ownership. If she starts naming people, she's shifting from prosecutor to patron. That's the most important signal in this meeting. If you need a moment to think, say so: 'Let me sit with that for a second.' She'll respect a named pause. She won't respect a frozen one. |
| **4 · PRESS PLAY** | |
| **She decides alone. Best move: create conditions where she proposes the next step herself. 'What would be useful to you?' or 'What would you want to see?' If she names the next step, it's hers — and she only deeply commits to things that are hers. If you must propose: keep it lightweight, specific, high-agency. An introduction she controls. An invitation to see something from the inside. Never something that locks her in.** | Don't summarize the meeting. She heard herself. If she proposes a different next step, take it immediately — she's telling you how she commits. But if the meeting is on fire — she's still building, still connecting, still riffing — don't interrupt to force a close. The building *is* the vector. Let the next step emerge from the energy. |
| **5 · UNLOCK THE NETWORK** | |
| **If energy is high: 'Who else is thinking about this intersection the way you are?' Write names down visibly — on paper between you, not on your phone. Make the list a shared artifact you're building together.** | If she offers introductions unprompted, that's a commitment — it may be worth more than money. Treat it as one. Follow up on every name within 48 hours. If she gives you three names and you follow up on two, she'll notice the missing one. The patron bar is high and the standard is follow-through. |

---

## READING THE ROOM

| WORKING | STALLING |
|---------|----------|
| Operational questions — how, who, how much. Interrupting to push back. Using 'we.' Telling you who to meet. Citing her own reporting. Getting genuinely angry. Riffing in real time — making connections out loud she hasn't made before. Asking about your world in ways she'd use in her own work. | Letting you talk uninterrupted. Generic praise ('so important'). Googleable questions. Pleasant but flat energy. Wrapping-up tone. Performing interest without interrogating. Giving you the entertaining Kara instead of the engaged one. |

**RESET MOVES**

- **If flat, go concrete.** Name a specific worker, a specific fight, a specific company. She's a reporter. Specifics re-engage her faster than any narrative.
- **If performing, show her something novel.** A new organizing model she hasn't covered. A data point that surprises her. She still gets excited by genuine innovation — that reflex is older and deeper than her skepticism.
- **If skeptical about labor, agree and show the insurgent model.** Don't defend unions. 'That's exactly the problem. The old model doesn't work for the people it's supposed to serve. Here's what the new one looks like.' Position DTW as the outsider operation. That's her frequency.

# MEETING GUIDE — ROY BAHAT

*Democracy Takes Work · February 2026 · Internal Use Only*

---

## THE DONOR READ

**POSTURE**

**He moved his family to Wisconsin to knock doors because the data said it might matter. He's not an analyst watching from a safe distance — he's someone who commits with his whole life when the evidence points to action.**
Arrive with a problem worth that kind of person's time. Not a deck. Not a vision. A live experiment where the outcome is uncertain and the stakes are real. Be more transparent than you'd normally be — share your actual numbers, your failures, your internal debates. He published his entire fund's operating manual open-source. Opacity reads as a mismatch in operating style. Bring a shared contact if you have one — someone from the labor or organizing world who can frame the introduction intellectually, not just warmly.

**WHAT LIGHTS THEM UP**

- **Ask for his help building something specific.**
  His deepest identity is enabler. He treats founders as customers — inverts the power dynamic so the person who needs capital is the person he serves. When you genuinely ask him to make you better at something, he shifts from evaluating to building.
- **Show what you've tested and what failed. Share the numbers.**
  He evaluates by falsification and builds trust through radical transparency. He quotes specific returns ("93 millionaires," "$75M returned"). Match his information density. Unguarded data earns his trust faster than polished narrative.
- **Surface a cross-domain connection he hasn't seen.**
  He teaches both media and organized labor at Berkeley — "seemingly unrelated fields" he uses to test theories about power and technology. If you can show him where worker organizing connects to something outside his existing frame — game theory, platform economics, municipal governance — he registers you as someone who thinks the way he does.
- **Frame the moment as an inflection point with a closing window.**
  He focuses on transition periods — 'the knee of the curve.' When something feels like it's about to change and there's a narrow window for action, his attention locks and his commitment deepens.

**WHAT SHUTS THEM DOWN**

- **Ideological assertion without evidence. He arrived at pro-labor through investigation, not politics. Assume shared methodology, not shared ideology.**
- **Wasting his time with information he could find himself. He calls this a sin — literally.**
- **Guarded or polished self-presentation. If you're vague about your budget, failure rate, or internal tensions, he'll read you as someone who doesn't operate the way he does.**
- **Pitching a fixed plan instead of a testable hypothesis. He funds iteration, not certainty.**

---

**THEY'LL READ YOU AS** · Another nonprofit asking a VC to write a check. Establish quickly that you think in systems, run experiments, and share information freely — that you operate the way his best founders do. Don't build personal rapport. Build intellectual rapport. This relationship deepens through shared work, not warmth.

**AUTHORSHIP THEY NEED** · Intellectual and structural, but in service mode. He needs to see the gap, propose how to test through it, and feel that his contribution made you more capable. The whole meeting should feel like he's helping you build something — not like you're trying to get his approval. When he starts sketching, stop talking. When he names who you should meet, write it down visibly.

**IF THIS COLLAPSES TO 5 MIN:** *Name one testable hypothesis about worker organizing at a closing inflection point — AI displacement, new economy precarity, post-Dobbs labor surge — and show why the window matters now. Ask if you can send him the diligence and get thirty minutes of his reaction. Low-commitment, high-learning. That's how he enters.*

---

## THE ALIGNMENT MAP

**PRIMARY TERRITORY**

**He runs the only venture fund focused on the future of work. DTW is building the worker-power infrastructure for that future. He's funding one side of the equation — DTW is funding the other.**
This isn't charity alignment. It's portfolio logic. Bloomberg Beta invests in companies that reshape how work happens. DTW invests in organizations that ensure workers have power as that reshaping occurs. He already chairs the Aspen roundtable on organized labor, invested in Union, teaches labor at Berkeley. You're not asking him to care about a new cause — you're showing him the missing piece of a system he's already building.

**SECONDARY TERRITORIES**

- **The testing gap in labor philanthropy.**
  Traditional labor funding is ideological, not experimental. DTW's portfolio approach — seeding EWOC, backing new organizing models, funding infrastructure — mirrors how Bloomberg Beta deploys capital. If he asks 'what's different about you,' this is the answer.
- **AI and worker power at the knee of the curve.**
  Workers in AI-adjacent industries need organizing infrastructure now, before the transformation is complete. This is his investment thesis applied to a different asset class. The window language will register — he thinks in inflection points, not steady states.
- **Dignity as a design requirement, not a sentiment.**
  He says what workers want is 'to be needed' and 'to belong.' That's not emotion — it's his framework for what any system serving workers must deliver. When the systems conversation has earned enough trust, there's a moment to drop in one specific human story — an organizer, a worker who gained agency. He leads with economics but what moves him is human capacity. Earn the moment, then use it.

**FIGHT OR BUILD** · **Open Build.** He's a designer, not a prosecutor. Lead with what you're constructing and where you're stuck. But if he names the threat himself — corporate consolidation, AI displacement, democratic erosion — follow him into Fight. Let him initiate the frame switch. He'll trust it more if it was his idea.

**HANDS ON THE WHEEL** · **Testing partner and connector who serves by making you more capable.** He doesn't want a title. He wants to pressure-test your hypotheses, connect you to specific people in his network, and see whether your model actually works. The highest-value next step may be experiential — he built his labor convictions at Labor Notes, in rooms with organizers. Put him in a room with EWOC organizers or a live campaign. That's how he learns. That's how he commits.

---

## THE MEETING ARC

*Try not to meet at Bloomberg Beta — a coffee shop or a walk gets the intellectual explorer, not the fund manager. The meeting starts in the small talk: reference something he's recently written or taught, as genuine engagement, not flattery. Don't open with your material — frame it as shared work: 'We're wrestling with something and want to think it through with you.' You're not taking turns. You're picking up what he puts down and building from inside it. If time gets short, skip content to protect the arc. Always land a next step.*

| THE MOVE | THE READ |
|----------|----------|
| **1 · GET THEM TALKING** | |
| **Ask what experiment or investment is teaching him the most right now about what's coming for workers. Not your framing — his. Let him answer with a framework. Then ask what it connects to that he didn't expect.** | If he names a specific company, campaign, or cross-domain tension, he's present. If he gives polished future-of-work language, he's screening — ask a follow-up that requires data he hasn't published. |
| **2 · LET THEM NAME THE STAKES** | |
| **Ask what happens to workers in his portfolio companies' industries if organizing infrastructure doesn't exist in five years. Don't say 'movement.' Don't say 'justice.' Let him arrive at the stakes in his own language. Then wait. Don't fill the silence — he's a thinker. If you rush to reframe, you'll get the analytical answer. If you wait, you might get the real one.** | Whatever framing he uses — 'demand destruction,' 'institutional vacuum' — adopt it. But listen for the shift underneath: if he starts talking about agency, belonging, people being needed — not as emotion but as design criteria — that's him telling you what he actually cares about. Follow it. |
| **3 · COMBINE YOUR WORLDS** | |
| **Bridge from his framing — credit his language when you connect it to the work. Then: 'We're testing whether philanthropic capital can do for worker organizing what venture does for startups — absorb early risk, prove models, then leverage larger pools. Here's where we're stuck.' Share real constraints — your budget, your failure rate, what's actually hard. When he starts redesigning, don't defend. Say 'that's the part we haven't solved.' As the shared picture takes shape, name the full scope: this is going to take expertise, partners, and resources to build. Make money part of the emerging design, not a separate ask.** | If he's asking operational questions with numbers, he's inside the frame. If he starts redesigning — sketching, mapping, building out loud — make it physical. Get something on paper between you. Build it together. Credit what he's adding — he needs to feel his contribution made you more capable. If he starts naming people, he's past evaluation into service mode. If he shifts from systems to human language — agency, dignity, belonging — that's your window for one specific story. A worker, an organizer. Earned, not performed. If you brought a one-pager or portfolio map, walk through it together now — don't hand it off to speak for itself. |
| **4 · PRESS PLAY** | |
| **He commits gradually, not all at once. Think side-project scale: 'Can I send you our diligence on one specific campaign and get thirty minutes of your reaction?' Or experiential: 'We're bringing [specific people] to meet organizers in [specific city] — want to come?' Frame the next step as the first iteration of an ongoing experiment. He escalates on his own terms.** | If he proposes a different next step, take it — he's telling you how he commits. If he offers to connect you to someone specific, that's more than politeness. If he says 'let me think about it,' that's honest, not a brush-off. He means it. If he's deep in a design problem — redesigning your model, working through a constraint — don't break the thread to force a close. The design session is the relationship. The next step will be obvious when you get there. |
| **5 · UNLOCK THE NETWORK** | |
| **'Who in your portfolio or your Aspen roundtable should be seeing what we're seeing?' Name a specific sector or problem — not 'who else cares about workers.' Write names down visibly — on paper between you. Make the list a shared artifact.** | Unprompted introductions are commitment. Naming a specific person with context — 'you need to talk to X because Y' — is even stronger. Follow up on every name within 48 hours. If he gives you three names and you follow up on two, he'll register the dropped one as exactly the kind of waste he calls a sin. |

---

## READING THE ROOM

| WORKING | STALLING |
|---------|----------|
| Redesigning your approach out loud. Asking operational questions with numbers. Referencing his portfolio, Aspen, or Berkeley work. Using 'we.' Naming specific people you should meet. Offering to falsify an assumption. Shifting from systems to human language — agency, belonging, dignity as design criteria. Sketching or building something with you physically. | Polished future-of-work talking points. Googleable questions. Complimenting the mission without engaging the model. Staying in 'you' language. Pleasant analytical distance. Advising rather than designing — telling you what to do instead of solving it with you. |

**RESET MOVES**

- **If he goes abstract, go granular.** Name a specific campaign, a specific failure, a specific cost. Unit economics of a union drive will re-engage a VC faster than narrative.
- **If he's advising instead of designing, hand him a real constraint.** 'We can't do X because Y — how would you solve that?' He can't resist an unsolved problem with real parameters. That's the move that flips him from audience to architect.
- **If he gets skeptical about legacy labor, agree completely.** 'That's exactly why we exist. The old model doesn't iterate. Here's what the new one looks like.' He funded Union for the same reason. Don't defend institutions he's already critiqued — show him you're building the replacement.

# MEETING GUIDE — LORI McGLINCHEY

*Democracy Takes Work · February 2026 · Internal Use Only*

---

## THE DONOR READ

**POSTURE**

**She already has a theory of how power operates in technology. Your job isn't to educate her — it's to show her that DTW fills a gap in her existing analysis.**
She's spent two decades building civil society infrastructure to challenge corporate and government power in digital systems. She thinks in systems, not programs. If you arrive with a program pitch, she'll listen politely and fund someone else. If you arrive with an analysis of how worker power is the missing layer in the tech accountability ecosystem she's already building, she'll start figuring out how to make it happen inside Ford. Bring a shared contact if you have one — ideally someone from the tech accountability or civil rights ecosystem she's funded or convened. It signals you're already in the network, not approaching from outside it.

**WHAT LIGHTS THEM UP**

- **Connect your specific work to a broader pattern of power concentration she's already tracking.**
  She maps where power systems intersect and intervenes at pressure points. If you can show her where worker organizing plugs into her existing tech accountability framework — not as a nice addition but as structural necessity — she shifts from evaluating to building.
- **Demonstrate that the people closest to the problem are leading your work.**
  She structured the Disability x Tech Fund to be designed by disabled leaders. She doesn't trust external expertise over lived experience. If DTW's portfolio is worker-led, show her the decision architecture. That's not sentiment — it's her criterion for what actually works.
- **Show her how your work forces powerful actors to change their behavior.**
  She measures impact by whether corporations and governments are forced to respond. Facebook changing ad targeting. DOJ requiring surveillance warrants. She wants to see leverage, not delivery.
- **Name her translation work and extend it.**
  She's built bridges between tech accountability and civil rights, between privacy advocates and disability justice. She sees herself as a translator between power systems and resistance movements. Show her you understand what she's built and that worker power is the next span of that bridge.

**WHAT SHUTS THEM DOWN**

- **Treating technology as politically neutral or worker organizing as separate from tech accountability. She requires grantees to articulate how their work addresses power, not just improves outcomes.**
- **Solutions that don't account for how power adapts. If you can't explain how corporations will route around your intervention, she'll fund someone who can.**
- **Justice language without systems analysis. She identifies when organizations co-opt social justice rhetoric without changing operations. Show her the mechanism, not the vocabulary.**
- **Service provision without a power analysis. She funds direct work only when it builds capacity for broader transformation. If DTW reads as charity for workers, you've lost her.**

---

**THEY'LL READ YOU AS** · A labor organization asking a tech funder for money. Establish immediately that you understand technology as a power system and that worker organizing is infrastructure for the same fights she's already funding — platform accountability, algorithmic justice, surveillance resistance. If DTW reads as adjacent to her program, not central to it, this stays a polite informational meeting.

**AUTHORSHIP THEY NEED** · Analytical and architectural. She sees herself as infrastructure for justice movements — temporary stewardship, not permanent authority. She builds systems designed to outlast her involvement. Show her DTW as infrastructure that becomes self-sustaining: if worker power works, it doesn't need perpetual philanthropic subsidy. That's her definition of success — funding things that eventually don't need her. Give her the ecosystem map and let her place you in it.

**IF THIS COLLAPSES TO 5 MIN:** *Name the specific gap: workers organizing inside tech companies are the missing civil society infrastructure in the accountability ecosystem she's already building. Nobody in her portfolio does this. Land the connection hard enough that she wants a longer conversation to map it.*

---

## THE ALIGNMENT MAP

**PRIMARY TERRITORY**

**She funds civil society infrastructure to challenge concentrated tech power from the outside. DTW builds worker power inside the same companies. This is the inside game to her outside game — and nobody in her portfolio is running it.**
She funds The Markup to investigate algorithmic systems. She funds spyware accountability. She funds disability justice in tech. But nobody in her portfolio organizes the workers inside Amazon, Google, or AI companies who have standing to challenge these systems from within. DTW's thesis — that organized workers are structural counterweight to concentrated corporate power — completes an ecosystem she's been building for a decade. This isn't a stretch. It's a gap she can see once you name it.

**SECONDARY TERRITORIES**

- **Labor tech as tech justice.**
  DTW's mandate includes building secure organizing technology outside corporate control. She's funded exactly this kind of infrastructure in other domains — privacy tools, secure communications, surveillance-resistant platforms. Labor tech is behind because nobody in her world has connected it to the tech justice frame yet. Make the connection explicit.
- **Worker organizing as surveillance resistance.**
  Workers at Amazon face the same corporate surveillance apparatus her grantees fight in other contexts. The Spyware Accountability Initiative protects activists from state surveillance. Workers organizing against employers need parallel infrastructure. Same fight, different target.
- **Ecosystem completion, not program addition.**
  She builds ecosystems, not portfolios. Show DTW as the missing node: investigative journalism + legal accountability + policy advocacy + community organizing + worker power. The network is incomplete without the people inside the companies. She'll see the pattern if you give her the pieces.

**FIGHT OR BUILD** · **Build that challenges power.** She doesn't separate construction from confrontation. Her Build always has an adversary — corporate power, surveillance systems, algorithmic discrimination. Lead with what you're building and name who it threatens. She doesn't fund work that isn't pushing against something.

**HANDS ON THE WHEEL** · **Co-builder who sits inside Ford.** If she decides to build this with you, your job shifts from convincing her to scheming with her — giving her the analysis, the evidence, and the framing she needs to make the case internally. The highest-value outcome isn't a single grant — it's Ford treating worker power as permanent infrastructure within Technology and Society. Think in decades. She does.

---

## THE MEETING ARC

*Try not to meet at Ford — her office puts her in program-officer mode with a queue of grantees. A coffee nearby gets the strategist. The meeting starts in the small talk: reference a specific initiative she's built — the Civil Rights Table, the Spyware Accountability Initiative — as genuine engagement with her body of work. Don't open with a pitch. She screens hundreds of those. Frame it as a shared mapping exercise: two parts of the same ecosystem that haven't been connected yet. You're not taking turns — you're building the map together in real time. If you brought an ecosystem map or a one-pager, it's a starting point she edits, not a finished product. If time gets short, skip content to protect the arc — always land a vector. One critical register note: if you talk in program language — outputs, deliverables, beneficiaries — you'll sound like a grantee. If you talk in systems language — power, infrastructure, ecosystem, leverage — you'll sound like a strategist she can build with.*

| THE MOVE | THE READ |
|----------|----------|
| **1 · GET THEM TALKING** | |
| **Frame the conversation as a cross-domain encounter she hasn't had yet: 'We come from the labor infrastructure side, you've built the tech accountability ecosystem. We think there's a connection between these worlds that nobody's made yet — and we want to map it with you.' Let her map the terrain from her side first.** | She learns by convening people who don't usually talk to each other. If she leans into the encounter — asking questions about your world, testing connections to hers — she's in learning mode. If she stays in informational-meeting register — polite, programmatic questions — she hasn't clicked into strategist mode yet. Ask what she'd build if she could redesign her portfolio from scratch. |
| **2 · LET THEM NAME THE STAKES** | |
| **Ask what happens to tech accountability if the workers inside these companies have no organized power. Don't say 'labor movement.' Don't say 'unions.' Let her arrive at the stakes through her own analysis of how civil society challenges corporate power. Then wait. Don't fill the silence — she's mapping a new connection in her head. If you jump in, you get her polite answer. If you wait, she maps DTW into her architecture herself.** | Listen for her framework — she'll think about this as an infrastructure gap. Whatever systems language she uses — 'there's no inside game,' 'civil society is only operating from the outside,' 'workers are the missing constituency' — adopt it. She just named your value proposition in her own words. If she starts getting energized — her language about forcing corporate behavior change carries visible enthusiasm — she's seeing it. |
| **3 · COMBINE YOUR WORLDS** | |
| **Map the ecosystem with her. Show her where worker organizing at Amazon connects to The Markup's investigations. Where labor tech connects to her surveillance resistance work. Where EWOC connects to civil rights infrastructure. Put the map between you — and let her redraw it. Credit her additions visibly. When she repositions a node or names a new connection, that's her taking ownership of the analysis. Share what's hard: where DTW's model is untested, where you lack infrastructure, what you haven't solved. As the shared picture takes shape, name what it will take to build this node: expertise, partners, and resources. Make money part of the ecosystem design, not a separate conversation.** | If she connects your work to specific grantees by name, she's past evaluation into ecosystem building. If she asks how you'd measure systemic impact — power shifted, corporate behavior changed, not outputs delivered — she's testing whether you think at her level. Answer in power terms. If she asks a hard analytical question and you need a moment, take it — she's testing for sophistication, and sophistication takes a beat. She'll trust a considered answer over a fast one. |
| **4 · PRESS PLAY** | |
| **You've been building the map together. Now point it forward: 'We've mapped where this fits — what would it take to actually build this?' That's a vector, not an application. If she starts working the problem — naming what Ford would need, who should see it, what the path looks like — you're scheming together. Arm her with whatever she needs to move it inside Ford. If she's not there yet, ask what's missing from the analysis.** | If she starts talking about internal Ford process — funding cycles, colleagues, review structures — she's scheming. She's figuring out how to make this real inside her institution. Listen carefully — she's giving you the playbook. If she names specific people at Ford you should talk to, she's already building the coalition. If she asks for a specific document or framing, build exactly what she asks for — she's telling you what weapons she needs. If she's deep in the ecosystem — still mapping, still connecting your work to hers — don't interrupt to force the question. The mapping is the scheming. She'll get there. |
| **5 · UNLOCK THE NETWORK** | |
| **'Who else in the tech accountability ecosystem should be thinking about worker power as infrastructure?' She convenes people who don't usually talk to each other — that's how she builds fields and how she learns. Be specific: name a domain or a gap. Write names down visibly — on paper between you.** | If she proposes connecting you to grantees, that's her placing you permanently in the ecosystem — more valuable than a grant signal. Her long-term relationships span decades. If this meeting goes well, you're launching a shared project that lasts years, not a funding cycle. Signal that you understand this: 'We're building infrastructure that should be permanent. We'd want a partner who thinks in those terms.' Follow up on every name within 48 hours. She builds field infrastructure — a dropped connection is a dropped node in the network she's designing. |

## READING THE ROOM

| WORKING | STALLING |
|---------|----------|
| Systems-level questions about power dynamics. Connecting your work to grantees by name. Redrawing the ecosystem map with you. Asking about your theory of systemic change. Naming people you should meet. Getting visibly energized about forcing corporate behavior change. Thinking out loud about Ford internal process — that's scheming, not stalling. | Programmatic questions about outputs and deliverables. Asking about your budget without asking about your power analysis. Complimenting the work without connecting it to her ecosystem. Informational-meeting tone — polite, contained, no ecosystem thinking. Treating 'the labor space' as separate from 'the tech space.' |

**RESET MOVES**

- **If she's in institutional mode, name a specific corporate adversary.** 'Amazon's warehouse surveillance system is the same infrastructure your grantees are fighting in other contexts. The workers inside are the only ones with standing to challenge it from within.' Concrete corporate behavior change pulls her out of process and into strategy.
- **If she's treating labor as separate from tech, make the connection physical.** Name a specific worker at a specific tech company facing a specific surveillance or algorithmic system she's already funding resistance to. Same fight, seen from the inside. She'll make the connection.
- **If she's skeptical about DTW's systems analysis, show her the ecosystem map.** Don't defend — show her where every piece of your portfolio connects to a piece of hers. She's a pattern recognizer. Give her the pattern and let it do the work.
