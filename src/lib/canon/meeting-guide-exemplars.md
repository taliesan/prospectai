# MEETING GUIDE — ROY BAHAT
*Democracy Takes Work · Opening Meeting · February 2026*

## THE DONOR READ

### POSTURE

He'll decide in the first five minutes whether you're a nonprofit asking for a check or a founder running a live experiment. If he puts you in the first category, he'll be polite and helpful but he won't invest — and you won't know it happened. To land in the second category: share your numbers before he asks for them, because that's how founders talk to him and it signals you operate the way his best investments do. Name a failure before you name a win, because he trusts people who show him what's broken more than people who show him what's working. Talk about this as both a market problem and a justice problem — he thinks about worker power as an economic force, not just a moral cause, and if your argument only works in one of those registers he'll lose interest. Don't ask about his family or his weekend. Ask what problem he's chewing on. The relationship starts when you're working on something together, not when you're getting along.

### WHAT LIGHTS THEM UP

- **Bring a specific number from the field.** What a union drive costs. Your conversion rate. Where you've lost. Match his information density or he'll read you as someone who's performing expertise rather than living it.
- **Arrive with a practitioner finding he hasn't heard.** Not a policy argument — a field result. "We found that when workers in warehouse campaigns get legal support in the first 30 days, the win rate doubles." That kind of specificity, grounded in practice, shifts his posture from evaluation to absorption.
- **Surface a cross-domain connection he hasn't made.** Show him where worker organizing connects to something outside his current frame — platform economics, municipal governance, AI labor markets. That signals you think the way he does.
- **Name the closing window concretely.** Not "this is an important moment" — "AI is reorganizing warehouse labor faster than anyone is organizing warehouse workers. In 18 months the workforce composition will be locked in and the leverage disappears." A specific window with a specific deadline. That's when his attention locks.

### WHAT SHUTS THEM DOWN

- **Standard pitch language or deference.** If you sound like a grantee making a case, he'll be pleasant and encouraging but he's already stopped evaluating. You won't get a rejection — you'll get a meeting that never turns into anything.
- **Justice language without market logic underneath.** Don't say "workers deserve better." Say "when workers have no power, companies lose the demand signal that tells them what to build." He arrived at pro-labor through economics, not politics. If your argument only works as a moral claim, he won't fight you on it — he just won't engage with it.
- **Guarded self-presentation.** If you're vague about your budget, your failure rate, or your internal tensions, he'll assume you're either hiding problems or you don't trust him enough to share them. Either way, the meeting stalls.
- **A fixed plan instead of a testable hypothesis.** If your model sounds finished, it sounds like you don't need him. He needs to be needed — his best relationships are with people he's helping build something that isn't done yet.

### HE'LL WALK IN EXPECTING

A pitch to evaluate. Break it before it sets: "We're wrestling with something and want to think it through with you."

### THEIR INNER TRUTH

He cares more about worker power than almost anything, but he can't say that directly — if he takes a firm ideological stance, the people he needs in the room (Bloomberg, corporate partners, skeptical investors) stop listening. So he frames everything as pragmatism and experimentation. The temptation is to say something like "you clearly believe in worker power" — but that forces him into a corner he's spent a career avoiding, and he'll start hedging and qualifying until the energy dies. Instead, let him arrive at the structural argument himself during Beat 2. Then name what you heard back to him: "That sounds like you think worker power is a market force, not a charity case." He'll either confirm or refine it. Either way, he's inside the frame on his own terms.

---

## THE ALIGNMENT MAP

### PRIMARY TERRITORY

Work is broken in America — he already believes this. The gap: nobody is deploying capital for worker organizing the way venture deploys capital for startups — absorbing early risk, proving models, then leveraging larger pools. DTW fills that gap. Philanthropic seed capital for organizing infrastructure, then early results to unlock union treasuries and foundation portfolios. In his language: "We're building the proof that unlocks everything else."

### SECONDARY TERRITORY 1

Workers in AI-affected industries are organizing right now without infrastructure. That's his future-of-work thesis made urgent and concrete — DTW's work lands on his timeline, not just yours.

### SECONDARY TERRITORY 2

Traditional labor funding picks sides based on ideology. DTW's portfolio approach mirrors how Bloomberg Beta deploys capital: seed multiple models, track what works, cut what doesn't. He'll recognize his own logic.

### SECONDARY TERRITORY 3

He says what workers want is "to be needed" and "to belong," and he means that as a design spec, not a sentiment. He leads with economics but what moves him is human capacity. One specific human story from the field — an EWOC intake call, an organizer who gained agency — reaches that part of him. But only after the systems conversation has built enough trust.

---

## THE MEETING ARC

### SETTING

Try not to meet at Bloomberg Beta. His office puts him in fund-manager mode — fiduciary obligations, Bloomberg LP constraints, the professional filter. A coffee shop or a walk gets the intellectual explorer. Somewhere noisy enough that you're both leaning in. Morning or lunch, not a scheduled 30-minute slot at the end of his day.

### ENERGY

You are not taking turns — you are picking up what he puts down and steering from inside his material. Don't present. Build. If time gets short, skip content to protect the arc — it's better to leave a beat thin than to lose the sequence. Always land a next step.

---

### BEAT 1 · GET THEM TALKING

**MOVE:**

Start with the person, not the substance. "What got you into the future-of-work space?" or "Where were you before Bloomberg Beta?"

You're listening for heat — whichever question gets him talking as a person rather than a fund manager, stay there.

When he's present, bridge: "What's teaching you the most right now about what's actually coming for workers?"

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] He names a specific company, campaign, or unexpected connection | He's present. Move to Beat 2.
[HOLD] Heat in his voice — frustration, excitement about something | Follow it. That's the real person.
[ADJUST] Smooth, rehearsed future-of-work take | He's on autopilot. Ask: "What are you seeing that consensus hasn't caught up to?"
[ADJUST] Flat energy, polite but not engaged | Name a specific number or counterintuitive result from your field. Watch whether it activates him.

---

### BEAT 2 · LET THEM NAME THE STAKES

**MOVE:**

"What happens to workers in your portfolio companies' industries if organizing infrastructure doesn't exist in five years?"

Don't say "movement." Don't say "justice." Let him arrive at the stakes in his own language.

Then wait. If you rush to reframe, you'll get the analytical answer. If you wait, you might get the real one.

Whatever language he uses, adopt it for the rest of the meeting.

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] He names the gap DTW fills unprompted — "nobody's absorbing the early risk" | Move to Beat 3. He just did your work for you.
[HOLD] He shifts to human language — agency, belonging, people being needed | That's what he actually cares about underneath the systems thinking. Follow it.
[ADJUST] He's in adjacent territory — AI, future of work, platform economics | Bridge: "How do you think about the workers inside those companies trying to organize right now, without infrastructure?"
[ADJUST] He stays analytical and distant | Deploy a number: "60 million workers want to join a union. No capital structure exists to help them. What would you build for that?"

---

### BEAT 3 · COMBINE YOUR WORLDS

**MOVE:**

Bridge from his language: "You just described the problem we're trying to solve."

Share real constraints — your budget, your portfolio, what's working, what's failing, where you're stuck.

When he starts redesigning, stop talking. Get something on paper between you. Credit what he adds.

As the shared picture takes shape, name the full scope: "The capital structure for this doesn't exist yet. It's going to take philanthropic seed capital, union treasuries unlocking at scale, and a donor community learning together. We're building the proof that unlocks everything else."

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] He's asking questions with numbers — costs, conversion rates, scale | He's inside the frame. Give him everything he asks for.
[HOLD] He starts redesigning your model out loud — "what if you structured it as..." | Stop talking. Let him build. This is the meeting working.
[ADJUST] He's still evaluating — asking "how does this work?" rather than building | Hand him a constraint: "We can fund five campaigns this year. Fifteen organizers. Three geographies. How would you allocate?"
[ADJUST] He's skeptical about legacy labor and unions | Agree: "That's exactly why we exist. The old model doesn't iterate. Here's the new one."
[ADJUST] He shifts to human language or names a threat | See the secondary territories for what to deploy and when.

---

### BEAT 4 · PRESS PLAY

**MOVE:**

Side-project scale. Frame the next step as the first iteration of an experiment — he escalates on his own terms.

"Can I send you our diligence on one campaign and get thirty minutes of your reaction?"

"We're bringing organizers and funders together — come sit in the room."

"Would you pressure-test our next portfolio decision? Not a board — a testing group."

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] He proposes a different next step | Take it. He's telling you how he wants to engage.
[HOLD] He says "let me think about it" | He means it. Don't push. Give him space.
[HOLD] He's still deep in a design problem | Don't break the thread. The design session is the relationship.
[ADJUST] He defaults to "send me something" | Convert it: "What specifically — the portfolio logic, one campaign, or the capital structure?"
[ADJUST] Energy is fading | Go minimum viable: "One page. Our three bets and why. Poke holes."

---

### BEAT 5 · UNLOCK THE NETWORK

**MOVE:**

Not "who else cares about workers" — "Who in AI ethics or platform governance is thinking about the labor side of this?"

Or: "Anyone in your Aspen roundtable or your portfolio who'd want to argue about whether this model works?"

Write names down visibly — make the list a shared artifact.

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] A name with context — "talk to X because Y" | He's investing social capital. Follow up within 48 hours. Every name.
[ADVANCE] He offers to make the introduction himself | That's the strongest signal in this meeting.
[HOLD] He names someone unexpected — outside labor, outside philanthropy | Pay close attention. That's his cross-domain vision, and he just shared a piece of it.
[ADJUST] He hesitates | He's scanning for risk. Don't push. "If anyone comes to mind later, I'd love to hear."

---

## READING THE ROOM

**WORKING:** Redesigning your model out loud · Asking questions with numbers · Using "we" · Naming people you should meet · Shifting to human language — agency, belonging · Offering to test an assumption

**STALLING:** Rehearsed talking points without data · Surface questions — budget, team size, founding date · Staying in "you" language · Complimenting the mission without engaging the model · Advising rather than designing · Hedging multiplying, scope narrowing

---

## RESET MOVES

**Gone abstract**
Name a number. "The average EWOC intake call is 47 minutes. The worker is usually in tears by minute 12."
WHY: He trusts people who've been close to the work. A specific number from the field pulls him out of analyst mode. The human detail reaches the part of him that cares about people, not just systems.

**Advising, not building**
Hand him a real constraint. "We can fund five campaigns this year. Fifteen organizers. Three geographies. How would you allocate?"
WHY: He can't resist an unsolved problem with real parameters. That's what flips him from giving advice to doing the work with you.

**Skeptical about unions**
Agree with him. "That's exactly why we exist. The old model doesn't iterate. Here's the new one." Then show him EWOC, worker-led campaigns, models that bypass NLRB.
WHY: His skepticism about legacy institutions is genuine, and it's what makes him fund alternatives. Don't defend what he's already critiqued — show him the replacement.

**Hedging everything**
Back off the substance. "We're not asking you to take a position. We're asking whether this would work."
WHY: Something pushed him toward committing to a stance he's not comfortable holding publicly. Pushing harder makes it worse. That sentence tells him he can engage without being recruited to a side.

# MEETING GUIDE — CRAIG NEWMARK
*Democracy Takes Work · Opening Meeting · February 2026*

---

## THE DONOR READ

### POSTURE

He decides within minutes whether you're someone who gets things done or someone wasting his time. He's pleasant to both, so you won't know which category you landed in until the follow-up never comes. To land as someone he funds: lead with a number, a result, or a specific problem you're solving. Connect your work to something he already cares about in the first thirty seconds — protecting people who serve the country, defending democratic institutions, or building durable systems for people who have no organized support. If the connection isn't obvious, make it explicit before he decides you're outside his zone. Match his compression — short sentences, no warmth, no rapport-building, immediate specifics. If you open with vision, inspiration, or try to build a personal connection first, he'll check out and you won't know it happened because he stays polite the whole time.

### WHAT LIGHTS THEM UP

- **Show him you know the problem from the inside.** Not policy. Not vision. Field results with numbers attached. He funds people who understand the work operationally, and the fastest way to prove that is to lead with a specific finding he hasn't heard before.
- **Be short.** Numbers first. If you can say it in ten words, don't use twenty. He communicates in compressed bursts — "Hey," then straight to specifics, no warmth, no preamble. If you match that, he reads you as someone who operates the way he does.
- **Know more than he does about the thing he's funding.** He knows he's shallow on everything he funds, and he's honest about it. He's looking for people who are deep where he's shallow. Show him you're that person and he'll trust your judgment on how to spend his money.
- **Frame everything as building, never as fighting.** If your ask sounds like confrontation, advocacy, or public pressure, he's out. If it sounds like building a durable system that protects people, you're speaking his language. Every organization he funds at scale is building infrastructure, not running campaigns.
- **Show him it's urgent and it'll last.** He's 73, he's signed the Giving Pledge, and he wants to spend everything during his lifetime. But the journalism school with his name on it shows he also wants the work to outlive the money. If your work solves a crisis right now and becomes a lasting institution, that's exactly what he's looking for.

### WHAT SHUTS THEM DOWN

- **Vision, inspiration, charisma, or strategic brilliance.** None of these move him. He doesn't respond to big ideas or compelling storytelling. He responds to people who can show him their operation works, inside a cause he already believes in. If you're relying on the force of your argument, you're using the wrong tool.
- **Rapport-building or warmth at the start.** He'll tolerate it, but he's waiting for you to get to the point. The longer you warm up, the more likely he is to decide you need a kind of interaction he can't provide — and he'll quietly write you off while staying perfectly pleasant.
- **Anything that sounds like blaming tech or platforms.** He's been fighting the "Craigslist destroyed journalism" accusation for a decade. If he hears even a hint that your framing points at tech as the problem, the meeting shifts from him evaluating you to him defending himself. He stays polite, but he's no longer listening.
- **Asking for his time, not just his money.** Board seats, strategy sessions, speaking engagements, events — anything that requires him to show up repeatedly. His best relationships are with organizations that take his resources and run. If your model needs his ongoing participation, you've disqualified yourself.
- **Looking like a promising experiment instead of a proven operation.** He gave $20 million to The Markup, a journalism startup that imploded due to leadership conflicts. That failure changed how he operates. He now puts every major commitment through established organizations with track records. If you look like an early-stage bet, he sees The Markup and backs away.

### HE'LL WALK IN EXPECTING

To evaluate whether you're someone he should fund or someone he needs to politely redirect. Break it by being an operator from the first sentence — a number, a result, a specific problem you're solving. Not "thank you for taking the time." Not "I've admired your work in journalism." He's already sorting you before you finish talking.

### THEIR INNER TRUTH

He built one of the most successful platforms in internet history while insisting he "kinda sucks" as a manager. The nerd identity is completely real — he genuinely struggles with social situations and reading people. But it also does something important for him: it lets him give away hundreds of millions of dollars while seeing himself as "just a nerd doing his part" rather than a billionaire exercising power. Without that frame, he'd need a different story about who he is, and he's never built one.

He also accepts far more public visibility than the "invisible nerd" story suggests — a journalism school with his name on it, regular press coverage, LinkedIn posts, the Giving Pledge announcement timed to his birthday. He'll take credit when it's framed as helping the mission. He won't take it when it's framed as honoring him.

The temptation is to either flatter the nerd frame — "you're too modest" — or challenge it — "you're more strategic than you let on." Both break the thing that lets him operate comfortably. Instead: accept it completely, work within it, and frame everything you need as resources going to people who get things done. If you need naming or public credit, frame it as helping the work — "having your name on this helps us recruit" — never as celebrating him.

---

## THE ALIGNMENT MAP

### PRIMARY TERRITORY

He believes American democratic infrastructure is under attack from multiple directions at once, and the institutions that should be organizing the defense can't keep up. That's why he funds cybersecurity, journalism, and veteran support — they're all parts of the same defense system. Workers are part of that system too. When the people keeping the country running have no way to organize, the whole infrastructure is more fragile. Nobody is building the support system that would let workers defend themselves the way cybersecurity protects networks or journalism protects accountability. DTW builds that. This isn't advocacy or confrontation. It's building a durable system that protects people who have no organized defense — which is exactly what he already funds, applied to a population no one else is covering. In his language: "We're building the immune system for worker organizing. It doesn't exist yet."

### SECONDARY TERRITORY 1

Worker organizing as part of democratic defense. The threats he worries about — disinformation, infrastructure attacks, institutional decay — all hit harder when workers have no way to organize a response. DTW builds the organizing layer for the labor side of the same problems he's already funding solutions for in cybersecurity and journalism.

### SECONDARY TERRITORY 2

DTW's model requires nothing from him beyond resources. Fund the operators, let the machine run. No board seats, no strategy sessions, no ongoing involvement. That's exactly how his best relationships work — Bob Woodruff Foundation, ProPublica, his cybersecurity network. He'll recognize the setup immediately.

### SECONDARY TERRITORY 3

Many workers in DTW's campaigns are veterans, military families, or essential workers — the same people he already supports through Bob Woodruff Foundation. Food insecurity, exploitation, lack of support infrastructure. Different entry point, same population. If this connection lands, it connects your work to people he's already committed to protecting.

---

## THE MEETING ARC

### SETTING

Short meeting. Coffee, not dinner. Not a gala. Not his office if you can help it — keep the setting simple so neither of you has to perform. Morning, not end of day. Twenty focused minutes is better than an hour of mixed signals. He doesn't need time to warm up. He needs you to get to the point.

### ENERGY

Compressed. Don't fill silence with rapport — when he's quiet, he's thinking, not uncomfortable. Lead with numbers and let him ask questions. If you're talking more than he is, you're probably pitching, and pitching is the wrong mode for him. Keep it short, specific, and operational. He's deciding whether your operation works well enough to fund, not building something with you.

---

### BEAT 1 · GET THEM TALKING

**MOVE:**

Start with the problem, not the person. He doesn't warm up through personal conversation. He warms up when you show him you know the problem.

"We're building organizing infrastructure for workers in [specific sector]. Here's what we're seeing." Or connect to his existing work: "The Bob Woodruff work on military families — we're seeing the same population from the labor side."

You're listening for whether he engages with the substance — asks a question, names a gap, mentions someone in his network — or stays pleasant and generic.

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] He asks an operational question — cost, scale, geography, conversion rate | He's evaluating you seriously. Move to Beat 2.
[ADVANCE] He names someone in his network — "Talk to Anne Marie" or "Bob Woodruff Foundation does something similar" | That's not a brush-off. That's how he works — he connects people through his network. Move to Beat 2 and integrate the connection.
[HOLD] Silence after your opening | He's thinking, not disengaged. Wait. Don't fill it.
[ADJUST] Pleasant but generic — "That sounds interesting" without a follow-up question | Your work hasn't connected to something he cares about yet. Make it explicit: "This is democratic infrastructure — the same framework as your journalism and cybersecurity work, applied to workers."
[ADJUST] He mentions Craigslist defensively or shifts to tech critique | You accidentally triggered the tech-blame frame. Pivot to building language immediately: "This isn't about what broke. Here's what we're building."

---

### BEAT 2 · LET THEM NAME THE STAKES

**MOVE:**

"What happens to the people doing essential work — not journalists, not cyber professionals, but the workers keeping systems running — if they have no organized support when the next disruption hits?"

Let him connect workers to the things he already cares about. Don't make the connection for him. If he gets there himself, you're most of the way to a commitment — because once he sees your work inside a cause he's already decided matters, the decision is almost already made.

Use his way of thinking, not yours. He understands the world through historical comparisons — "like World War II," "the immune system of democracy." If you can put the worker organizing gap inside one of those frames, it lands faster than any new argument you could build.

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] He connects workers to something he already funds — "that's the same problem as..." or "nobody's organizing the defense" | He sees it. Move to Beat 3.
[HOLD] He's naming specific populations — veterans, military families, essential workers | He's mapping your work onto people he already cares about. Follow his mapping. Use his populations, not yours.
[ADJUST] He treats it as adjacent but outside his area — "that's important but not really my thing" | Bridge through a population he's already committed to: "Forty percent of the workers in our campaigns are veterans or military spouses. Same people, different entry point."
[ADJUST] He asks about the political dimension — unions, labor movement, organizing | Stay in building language: "We don't do advocacy or confrontation. We build infrastructure that lets workers organize. Same approach as your cybersecurity work — build the system, let the operators run it."

---

### BEAT 3 · COMBINE YOUR WORLDS

**MOVE:**

Show him the machine. What it costs to run an organizing campaign. Your win rate. Where you've failed and what you learned.

Frame the scope with numbers: "We need $X to run Y campaigns across Z geographies this year. Here's what each one costs and what the expected conversion looks like."

He doesn't want to help you design it. He wants to see that it works and then fund it. Give him the data to make that evaluation. If he asks for more numbers, give him everything without rounding or summarizing.

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] He asks "how much do you need" or "what's the budget" | He's past evaluation. Give him the number. Be specific. Don't hedge.
[ADVANCE] He names a specific person to route this through — "send this to Bob Woodruff Foundation because..." | That's how he commits. The intermediary is the path. Move to Beat 4.
[HOLD] He's asking detailed operational questions — costs, geography, staffing, failure rates | He's evaluating whether you're someone he can trust with resources. Give him everything. Don't summarize. Don't round.
[ADJUST] He's comparing you to failed bets — "how do I know this won't collapse" | Show him the difference: established operations, track record, proven campaigns. "We've run X campaigns. Here are the results. Here's what failed and what we changed."
[ADJUST] He's polite but hasn't asked a single number question | He hasn't decided you're worth evaluating seriously. Offer him the data directly: "Can I show you our campaign economics? Thirty seconds."

---

### BEAT 4 · PRESS PLAY

**MOVE:**

Different rules here. He doesn't do pilots or phased approaches. When he decides to fund something, the commitment is large and immediate. When he doesn't, he redirects you to someone in his network.

Frame the ask at full scale: "Here's what we need and what it funds." Or if you sense he's redirecting: "Can we send you the full operational breakdown so you can evaluate at your pace?"

If he names a specific person — "talk to Anne Marie," "send it to Bob Woodruff Foundation" — that's not rejection. That's how he operates. Every major commitment goes through his network of trusted intermediaries. The person he names is the path forward, not the consolation prize.

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] He asks where to send resources or names a specific amount | Decision is made. Give him the logistics. Keep it operational.
[ADVANCE] He routes you to a specific person and explains why — "talk to X because they handle Y" | That's a commitment. Follow up with the intermediary within 48 hours using exactly his framing.
[HOLD] He's still asking operational questions | He's not done evaluating. Don't rush the ask. Let him finish.
[ADJUST] He routes you to someone without context — just "talk to X" | That might be redirecting you away rather than toward something. Ask: "Happy to. What should I tell them you want them to look at?"
[ADJUST] "Send me something" without specifics | Convert it: "One page — our campaign economics and where the money goes. I'll have it to you tomorrow."

---

### BEAT 5 · UNLOCK THE NETWORK

**MOVE:**

Don't ask "who else cares about workers?" He connects people who work on similar problems, not people who believe in similar things.

Ask about adjacent operators: "Who in your veteran support network is seeing worker exploitation as a force protection issue?" Or: "Anyone in your cybersecurity work dealing with the labor side of critical infrastructure?"

Frame the referral the same way — specific problem, specific population, specific overlap with something he's already working on.

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] He names someone with context — "talk to X, they're seeing the same thing in Y" | That's social capital. Follow up within 48 hours with exactly the framing he gave you.
[ADVANCE] He offers to make an introduction directly | Strongest signal in this meeting. He's invested.
[HOLD] He names someone from a completely different domain — cybersecurity, journalism, policy | He's seeing a connection you haven't made yet. Ask him what he sees.
[ADJUST] He doesn't engage with the network question | Don't push. He may not be ready to put his name behind you yet. Close clean and follow up in writing.

---

## READING THE ROOM

**WORKING:** Asking operational questions with numbers · Naming specific people in his network · Silence — that's thinking, not disengagement · "How much do you need" · Sending you to a specific person and explaining why · Comparing you to an operation he already funds

**STALLING:** Pleasant but generic — "that sounds interesting" without follow-up · Humor without operational content · Sending you to someone without explaining why · Complimenting the mission without engaging the model · Staying at the level of "that's important work" · No number questions after five minutes

---

## RESET MOVES

**Redirecting you away**
He's suddenly sending you to intermediaries when he wasn't doing that before. Return to operational specifics — numbers, results, what you've learned from failures. Don't address what triggered the shift.
WHY: He gave $20 million to The Markup, a journalism startup that imploded. That experience rewired how he evaluates new organizations. When something reminds him of that bet, he protects himself by sending you to his network instead of engaging directly. The only way back in is to show him you're a proven operation, not a promising experiment.

**Tech blame activated**
Something you said implicated tech or platforms in the problem. Don't address it directly. Pivot immediately: "This isn't about what broke. Here's what we're building to replace it."
WHY: He's been fighting the accusation that Craigslist destroyed journalism for a decade. Once he's in that defensive posture, he's not evaluating your work anymore — he's protecting himself. The only recovery is to move into building language so clearly that the defensive posture has nothing left to hold onto.

**You're talking too much**
Short responses, minimal engagement. Stop. Ask one operational question. Let him lead with whatever he asks next.
WHY: He communicates in compressed bursts — no rapport, no preamble, no emotional scaffolding. If you're running long, you're signaling that you need a kind of conversation he doesn't do. He's not going to tell you that. He'll just gradually stop engaging.

**Scope creep**
He's asking whether this expands beyond his areas. Reassure him directly: "This is infrastructure for the people doing essential work. Same approach as your cybersecurity and veteran work. Different population, same framework."
WHY: Early in his philanthropy he spread his giving too thin and regretted it. He narrowed to a few areas where he could evaluate the work himself and refused to go outside them. If he senses you want him to expand into a new cause, he'll retreat to safety — not because the work isn't good, but because he doesn't trust his own judgment outside his lanes.

# MEETING GUIDE — LORI MCGLINCHEY
*Democracy Takes Work · Opening Meeting · February 2026*

## THE DONOR READ

### POSTURE

Lead with where your work lands inside hers — not with what your organization does. She runs Ford's Technology and Society program: antimonopoly, AI governance, surveillance, digital rights. DTW's work touches at least three of those directly. If you open with "we organize workers against tech monopolies" you're inside her program on the first sentence. If you open with "we build worker organizing infrastructure," she has to do the translation herself — and she may not. Show her the overlap is specific, not abstract. Talk about the workers being affected by the technologies she already studies, the monopolies she already funds against, and the fact that the organizing field depends entirely on tools built by the companies workers are trying to hold accountable. That's her problem described from the labor side, and she'll recognize it immediately.

### WHAT LIGHTS THEM UP

- **Show her a gap where people are doing real work with nothing connecting them.** Public interest technology wasn't a named field when Ford started building it. The Disability x Tech Fund existed because nobody had noticed the absence. When she sees practitioners working without any infrastructure — no shared learning, no pipeline, no coordinated funding — her posture shifts from evaluation to collaboration. That's the moment you want.
- **Show her that the people most affected are leading the design.** Not consulted. Not included. Leading. The Disability x Tech Fund had an advisory committee of people with disabilities who nominated and selected grantees. If you can show her that workers are designing DTW's approach, not receiving it, you've passed her most important test.
- **Show her an investment that ends because it worked.** The PIT University Network was designed so universities would institutionalize public interest tech after the philanthropic money ran out — and they did. If your model produces self-sustaining institutions rather than permanent dependence on philanthropy, she'll recognize the logic immediately.
- **Name the other funders who should be at the table.** Almost nothing in her portfolio is Ford-only. She co-built the Antimonopoly Fund with the Economic Security Project, launched the Spyware Initiative with Apple, OSF, and Craig Newmark Philanthropies. If your work is positioned to attract multiple foundations sharing a strategy, she sees a field that's ready to be built. Have the names ready.

### WHAT SHUTS THEM DOWN

- **Talking about what your organization has accomplished.** She funds fields, not programs. If your pitch is "here's what we've done," she's hearing a grantee making a case. Reframe around what the field needs and where your work fits inside it.
- **Presenting technology as a solution without talking about power.** Her entire career is built on the insight that technology makes inequality worse unless the people affected have the capacity to intervene. If you talk about tools without talking about who has power and who doesn't, she stops taking you seriously.
- **Building something for a community instead of with them leading.** If workers aren't designing the work — actually designing it, not being consulted about it — you've shown her you don't understand the principle she's built her career around. This is the fastest way to lose her.
- **Asking Ford to fund this alone.** Asking one foundation to fund something signals that either no one else is interested or you haven't thought about sustainability. Both are disqualifying. She'll ask who else is at the table. Have an answer.
- **Making Ford the hero of the story.** Don't say "with Ford's support, we could transform worker organizing." Her institutional voice deliberately distributes credit and agency — she never positions Ford as the protagonist. If your framing puts Ford at the center, you're misreading how she thinks about the foundation's role.

### SHE'LL WALK IN EXPECTING

A labor organization pitching Ford for funding. Break it: "We're not here as a labor organization. We organize workers against tech monopolies, we're dealing with AI displacement across every sector we work in, and the entire organizing field depends on tools owned by the companies our workers are trying to hold accountable. That's your problem from the labor side."

### THEIR INNER TRUTH

She builds coalitions to counterbalance concentrated power, but the coalition model requires working with the concentrators. Ford co-launched the Spyware Accountability Initiative with Apple — the same Apple whose market practices are targets of the antimonopoly movement Ford also funds. She sits on Partnership on AI between the ACLU and Microsoft.

This isn't hypocrisy — it's how field-building works at Ford's scale. The foundation can't fund direct opposition to its own partners without destroying the coalitions that make everything else possible. But it can fund the conditions — university pipelines, civil rights tables, legal infrastructure — that produce opposition organically. She funds the capacity. The field decides what to do with it.

Don't force her to name this tension. Don't position DTW as adversarial to anyone Ford works with. Show her that DTW builds the capacity for workers to organize on their own terms — and that what workers do with that capacity is their decision, not yours. If she sees DTW as infrastructure that creates conditions rather than an organization that takes positions, the institutional constraints stop being a problem.

## THE ALIGNMENT MAP

### PRIMARY TERRITORY

DTW organizes workers against tech monopolies. Ford's Antimonopoly Fund — $10 million co-funded with the Economic Security Project — is built on the principle that "the greatest threat to monopoly power is distributed power, where a well-resourced field of advocates work across sectors with common purpose." DTW is the labor side of that distributed power. The workers in Amazon warehouses, on gig platforms, inside contracted tech supply chains — they're the people most directly affected by the monopoly concentration Ford already funds against, and they have no organized voice in the fight. DTW gives them one. This isn't a bridge from labor to tech. It's the missing piece of her existing antimonopoly work.

### SECONDARY TERRITORY 1

AI is displacing workers across every sector DTW operates in. Warehouse automation, algorithmic scheduling, AI-driven hiring and firing — the economic justice consequences are landing on the workers least equipped to organize a response. Ford's Tech and Society program exists because technology reproduces inequality when the people most affected are excluded from governing it. Those people are DTW's members. The workers being displaced by AI have no seat at the tables where AI governance decisions get made.

### SECONDARY TERRITORY 2

The entire organizing field depends on corporate-owned technology. Workers coordinate on Slack, organize on WhatsApp, communicate through Gmail — tools built and owned by the same companies they're trying to hold accountable. There's no Signal for worker organizing. No movement-owned infrastructure that serves the resistance rather than surveilling it. Ford funded the Spyware Accountability Initiative because people fighting power need tools that aren't controlled by the powerful. The same logic applies to labor, and nobody's building for it.

### SECONDARY TERRITORY 3

DTW's model is designed for co-funding. Its portfolio spans multiple organizing models — worker centers, digital campaigns, sector-specific drives — which means multiple foundations can fund different parts of the same strategy. One funder takes the tech-worker track, another takes the AI-displacement campaigns, a third funds the movement-tech infrastructure. That's the entry point for a coalition, and she's the person who knows how to build one.

## THE MEETING ARC

### SETTING

Her office at Ford is fine — she's institutional and the setting should match. A smaller meeting is better than a large one. In a small group or one-on-one, she's more likely to tell you what she actually thinks — what she's learned, where things have failed, what surprised her. In a larger meeting, you'll get the polished Ford position. The candid version is where the real work happens.

### ENERGY

She thinks about how things connect across institutions, not about individual organizations or stories. Lead with where DTW's work overlaps with her program, not with what DTW has accomplished. Don't pitch. Map the overlaps with her. She's at her best when she's helping design something that connects fields that aren't yet connected. If you can get her drawing the connections between antimonopoly, AI displacement, and movement tech, the meeting is working.

---

### BEAT 1 · GET THEM TALKING

**MOVE:**

Start inside her program, not outside it. "Ford's antimonopoly work is built on the idea that concentrated power needs distributed counter-power. We're seeing the labor side of that — workers inside monopoly supply chains with no organized voice. We want to understand how you're thinking about the labor dimension."

You're listening for whether she's giving you the official Ford answer or telling you what she actually thinks. If she talks about what she's seeing in the field, what gaps worry her, or how AI is changing the landscape, she's engaged as a person who builds fields. If she gives you the polished version, she's being professional but not yet present.

Stay here until she's talking as someone who thinks about these problems, not as someone who represents Ford.

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] She starts connecting your work to specific parts of her program — antimonopoly, AI governance, digital rights | She's seeing the overlap. Move to Beat 2.
[HOLD] She's asking you questions about what workers are experiencing — AI displacement, surveillance, algorithmic management | She's mapping the problem. Give her the specifics. Let her fill in the connections she sees.
[ADJUST] Polished, precise language — the official Ford answer, distributed agency | She's being professional but not yet present. Get specific: "What are you seeing from grantees about AI's impact on workers? Is anyone building the organizing side?"
[ADJUST] She's already evaluating your organization — asking about your budget, your team, your track record | She's in funder mode. Redirect: "Before we get into our work — we're trying to understand where the labor side of antimonopoly sits. Can we map it together?"

---

### BEAT 2 · LET THEM NAME THE STAKES

**MOVE:**

"Ford funds against monopoly concentration. Ford funds AI governance. Ford funds digital rights and surveillance resistance. But the workers who are most affected by all three — the people inside the monopoly supply chains, being displaced by AI, organizing on tools owned by the companies they're fighting — they have no organized infrastructure. Does that gap register for you?"

Let her name it. If she connects the labor gap to her existing program areas — "nobody's building the organizing side" or "that's the missing piece" — you're most of the way there. She's mapped DTW into work she's already doing rather than seeing it as something new.

Don't rush to present your solution. Let her sit with the gap between her program areas and the workers those programs are supposed to serve.

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] She connects the labor gap to her existing work — "nobody's building that" or "that's what's missing" | She sees it inside her program. Move to Beat 3.
[HOLD] She's naming specific impacts — AI displacement in specific sectors, surveillance of specific workers | She's building the case herself. Let her. Write it down. These are the specifics that make the concept note.
[ADJUST] She treats this as a labor issue rather than a tech issue — "that sounds like it belongs with our economic equity colleagues" | Bridge through the tech: "The displacement is technological. The surveillance is technological. The tools they organize on are owned by the companies they're fighting. The solution is labor, but the problem is tech."
[ADJUST] She questions whether the gap is real — "there's labor infrastructure for this, AFL-CIO, established unions" | Agree and distinguish: "Traditional labor infrastructure isn't built for workers fighting tech monopolies. It wasn't designed for AI displacement. And it runs on corporate-owned tools. The tech-labor intersection is the gap."

---

### BEAT 3 · COMBINE YOUR WORLDS

**MOVE:**

Show her how DTW's work maps onto her program. Not the whole organization — the specific overlaps. Which campaigns are organizing workers against monopoly supply chains. Which workers are facing AI displacement. What tools the field depends on and why that's a problem.

Then show her where the connective tissue is missing: "There's nobody connecting the antimonopoly advocacy funders to the people organizing workers inside those monopolies. There's nobody building movement-owned tech for organizers. DTW sits at that intersection."

Name the co-funding logic: "This can't be one foundation's work. We're designed to bring multiple funders into a shared strategy — here's who we're talking to and what that looks like."

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] She's adding to the map — "what if you connected this to..." or "have you talked to..." | She's building with you. Stop pitching. Co-design.
[ADVANCE] She asks about the co-funding strategy in detail — which foundations, what shared learning looks like | She's evaluating whether this can become a coalition. Give her everything. Name the foundations. Show the shared strategy.
[HOLD] She's asking about who leads the design — which workers, which communities, what governance | This is her most important test. Show her that workers lead. Name specific governance structures where workers make the decisions.
[ADJUST] She's evaluating your organization rather than the overlap — budget, team, track record | Pull back to the field: "Before our organization — is there a gap at the intersection of your antimonopoly work and labor? If the gap is real, we can talk about who fills it."
[ADJUST] She raises Ford's institutional constraints — partner relationships, political exposure | Don't argue. Reframe: "We don't take positions against anyone. We build the capacity for workers to organize. What they do with that capacity is their decision, not ours."

---

### BEAT 4 · PRESS PLAY

**MOVE:**

The question she'll ask before she commits to anything: "What happens after the money runs out?"

Have the answer ready: "The campaigns produce organizers. The organizers build unions. The unions are self-sustaining institutions with revenue from dues. The philanthropic investment is catalytic — it ends because it worked, not because it ran out."

Frame the next step as a co-design exercise, not a funding request: "Can we come back with a map of where the labor dimension touches your program areas, and a co-funding proposal? Not a grant request — a strategy for how this intersection gets built."

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] She names other foundations or programs that should be at the table | She's building the coalition in her head. Write them down. Ask what each one would bring.
[ADVANCE] She suggests a specific Ford process — "submit a concept note" or "let me talk to my colleagues" | That's Ford's institutional pathway opening. Take it exactly as she describes it. Ask what the concept note should emphasize.
[HOLD] She's still mapping the overlaps with you — adding connections, questioning assumptions | Don't rush to the ask. The mapping is the relationship. The next step will emerge from it.
[ADJUST] She says this is interesting but not clearly within Tech and Society's scope | Ask where it might fit: "If not Tech and Society, who at Ford should we be talking to? Or is this a cross-program opportunity?"
[ADJUST] She's encouraging but vague — "keep us posted" without a specific next step | Convert it: "Would it be useful if we came back with the overlap map and a co-funding framework? We can have that in two weeks."

---

### BEAT 5 · UNLOCK THE NETWORK

**MOVE:**

For her, the network question is the co-funder question. Don't ask "who else cares about workers?" Ask: "Who's funding the antimonopoly side that should know about the labor dimension? Who's working on AI displacement that should be connected to organizing?"

She sits on seven governance boards and knows who's funding what across the entire tech-and-society space. If she starts naming foundations and explaining what each one cares about, she's designing the coalition for you.

Also ask about the movement-tech angle: "Is anyone funding resistance technology for organizers? Encrypted tools, movement-owned platforms, alternatives to the corporate stack?"

**SIGNALS:**

[ADVANCE] She names specific foundations with context — "MacArthur cares about X, Hewlett is doing Y" | She's designing the coalition. Write everything down. Ask: "Would an introduction from you help?"
[ADVANCE] She offers to raise it with colleagues at Ford or other foundations | That's the strongest signal. She's putting her institutional credibility behind your work.
[HOLD] She names connections outside philanthropy — universities, governance bodies, civil rights organizations | She's thinking about the full field, not just funding. Follow her mapping. These connections matter as much as money.
[ADJUST] She doesn't engage with the coalition question | She may not see the overlap as ready. Close with: "What would need to be true for this intersection to be ready for a coalition approach?"

## READING THE ROOM

**WORKING:** Connecting your work to specific parts of her program — antimonopoly, AI governance, digital rights · Asking about what workers are experiencing with AI, surveillance, monopoly employers · Naming specific foundations or institutions that should be involved · Asking about who leads the design and what governance looks like · Talking about what she's learned, what surprised her, what she'd do differently · Asking what happens after the money runs out

**STALLING:** Giving polished Ford answers without personal engagement · Treating this as a labor issue rather than a tech-and-society issue · Evaluating your organization instead of the overlap with her program · Complimenting the work without connecting it to anything she does · Questioning whether this fits within Tech and Society's scope · Encouraging but vague — "keep us posted" with no next step

## RESET MOVES

**Stuck in funder mode**
She's evaluating your organization instead of the intersection. Pull back: "Forget about us for a minute. Is there a gap where your antimonopoly work meets labor? If that gap is real, we can talk about who fills it."
WHY: She's at her best when she's designing how to connect fields that aren't yet connected, not reviewing proposals. If the meeting stays in grantee-evaluation mode, you're competing with every other organization on her desk. If it moves to field-design mode, you're collaborating on something she already cares about.

**Scope question**
She's questioning whether worker organizing fits Tech and Society. Lead with the tech: "The displacement is technological. The surveillance is technological. The tools organizers depend on are owned by the companies workers are fighting. The solution is labor, but the problem is tech."
WHY: Worker organizing sounds like a labor issue. But the workers most affected by the technologies she's been working on for a decade — AI, surveillance, platform monopolies — are the same workers who need organizing infrastructure. The bridge is the technology, not the issue area.

**Coalition concern**
She's worried about Ford's institutional constraints — partner relationships, political exposure. Don't argue. Reframe: "DTW doesn't take positions against anyone. We build the capacity for workers to organize. What they do with that capacity is their decision, not ours."
WHY: Ford co-funds with corporations whose labor practices may be exactly what workers are organizing against. She can't fund something that looks like direct opposition to Ford's partners. But she's spent her career funding the conditions that produce opposition organically — university pipelines, legal infrastructure, civil rights tables. Show her DTW fits the same logic: build the capacity, and the field decides what to do with it.

**Sustainability doubt**
She's not convinced the work sustains itself. Go specific: "Each campaign produces organizers. Each organizer builds a union. Each union collects dues. The philanthropic dollar funds the catalyst. The institution funds itself."
WHY: Her test for every investment: does this build something permanent, or does it create permanent dependence on philanthropy? If she thinks your work needs foundation money forever, she sees a program. If she sees a catalytic investment that produces self-sustaining institutions, she sees something she's built before.
