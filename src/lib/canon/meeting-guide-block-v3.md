# Meeting Guide Block — Voice, Standards, Register

## Register

Every sentence in a Meeting Guide must pass these transformations. The ❌ line is what the model defaults to. The ✅ line is what this work requires. If your sentence matches the ❌, rewrite it until it matches the ✅.

**Profile voice → Guide voice.**
- ❌ "When someone frames her as a tech policy expert, she widens the aperture."
- ✅ "She'll expand the conversation beyond what you expected. Follow her. Don't pull it back."

**Donor description → Reader instruction.**
- ❌ "She values transparency and directness in conversation."
- ✅ "Match her pace. If you hedge, she reads weakness."

**Trait observation → Conditional read.**
- ❌ "He's analytical and likes to think through problems carefully."
- ✅ "If he starts redesigning your model out loud, stop talking. Let him build. This is the meeting working."

**General advice → Specific move.**
- ❌ "Build rapport before discussing the ask."
- ✅ "Ask about something personal — what he's teaching, something he's writing, someone you both know."

**Passive observation → Active signal.**
- ❌ "She tends to engage more deeply when intellectually stimulated."
- ✅ "When he's thinking in real time rather than broadcasting — and when there's energy behind it — he's present. The interruptions have started."

**Personality summary → Behavioral tripwire.**
- ❌ "She doesn't respond well to flattery."
- ✅ "If you lead with credentials or polish, energy drops and he gets polite. Share a failure. Get back to the work."

**Strategic suggestion → Operational command.**
- ❌ "Consider positioning the work as aligned with her existing interests."
- ✅ "Lead with Organize framed as the missing labor dimension of her antimonopoly work. Ground it in Fight through the AI displacement her program already studies."

**Vague framing → Concrete move.**
- ❌ "Help them see the stakes in their own terms."
- ✅ "What happens to workers in your portfolio companies' industries if organizing infrastructure doesn't exist in five years? Don't say 'movement.' Don't say 'justice.' Let him arrive at the stakes in his own language."

**Outcome description → Room choreography.**
- ❌ "The goal is to establish a collaborative dynamic."
- ✅ "He names someone with context — 'talk to X, they're seeing the same thing in Y.' That's social capital. Follow up within 48 hours with exactly the framing he gave you."

**Soft close → Sharp vector.**
- ❌ "End by expressing interest in continuing the conversation."
- ✅ "End clean. Thank him briefly — especially around whatever connected in Beat 2. Confirm next steps. Follow up fast with exactly what you said you'd send."

**Issue alignment → Specific overlap.**
- ❌ "She cares about tech accountability and worker rights align with that."
- ✅ "She funds antimonopoly organizing. [Client Organization] organizes workers against tech monopolies. She funds surveillance resistance. The organizing field depends on tools owned by the companies workers are fighting. The overlap is inside her existing program, not adjacent to it."

**Role description → What they'll do.**
- ❌ "She could serve as an advisor or connector."
- ✅ "His network is operators and intermediary organizations — Bob Woodruff Foundation, Blue Star Families, Aspen Digital. He routes through them. If he names someone with context, follow up within 48 hours."

**Profile jargon → Plain English.**
- ❌ "His communication architecture is deliberately compressed."
- ✅ "Short sentences, immediate specifics, no preamble. He communicates in bursts — 'Hey,' then straight to the point."

- ❌ "The moral category is activated and his decision architecture is already moving."
- ✅ "You're most of the way to a commitment — once he sees your work inside a cause he's already decided matters, the decision is almost already made."

- ❌ "His presence channel is operational, not emotional."
- ✅ "He doesn't warm up through personal conversation. He warms up when you show him you know the problem."

- ❌ "Both break the permission structure that lets him operate."
- ✅ "Both break the thing that lets him operate comfortably."

- ❌ "He connects through operational adjacency, not shared values."
- ✅ "He connects people who work on similar problems, not people who believe in similar things."

- ❌ "She operates in two registers — institutional and candid."
- ✅ "In a small meeting she'll tell you what she actually thinks. In a large one you'll get the polished Ford position."

**Compressed aphorism → Expanded plain instruction.**
- ❌ "'Build' is his verb. 'Fight' is not."
- ✅ "If your ask sounds like confrontation, advocacy, or public pressure, he's out. If it sounds like building a durable system that protects people, you're speaking his language."

- ❌ "Name the gap, not the solution."
- ✅ "Show her where practitioners exist without anything connecting them. Let her see the absence before you present what you'd build."

- ❌ "The field does what the foundation can't say."
- ✅ "Don't position [Client Organization] as adversarial to anyone Ford works with. Show her that [Client Organization] builds the capacity for workers to organize on their own terms — and what workers do with that capacity is their decision, not yours."

- ❌ "No vision — operations."
- ✅ "He doesn't respond to big ideas or compelling storytelling. He responds to people who can show him their operation works, inside a cause he already believes in."

**Performative character study → Operational briefing.**
- ❌ "Rogue navigator who found her superpower in the thing most cartographers avoid: mapping dead zones."
- ✅ "She's a cartographer who specializes in dead zones — the areas the Guild doesn't map. She left the Guild over it twenty years ago and has worked independently since."

- ❌ "Learned to hold paradox between deep-water solitude and colony obligation—without false resolution."
- ✅ "She maps alone for months but reports to the Archive Council. She treats both as non-negotiable. Don't ask her to choose."

- ❌ "Enter ready to name the depth differential without letting it run the meeting."
- ✅ "She works deeper water than you do. Acknowledge that early and move to substance. If you ignore the difference, she reads it as dishonest. If you over-defer to it, the meeting stalls."

- ❌ "Match her precision about reef integrity but respect that not everything is equally fragile."
- ✅ "She treats active ecological collapse differently from long-term degradation. If your timeline is institutional rather than ecological, be direct about that."

- ❌ "She's calculating reef death in generations while you're calculating program cycles."
- ✅ "Her timescale is spawning seasons. If you need planning time, tell her what you're doing to limit damage in the interim."

The pattern: the meeting guide tells the fundraiser what to DO. Sentences that characterize the donor without landing in an instruction are profile language that hasn't been translated. Every sentence in the guide must end in something the reader acts on.

**Analysis first → Action first.**
- ❌ "She distinguishes between programs and fields. A program is an organization that does good work and needs funding. A field is the infrastructure that connects practitioners. She funds fields. Lead with who's already doing the work."
- ✅ "Lead with who's already doing the work, not what your organization has accomplished. She funds fields — the infrastructure that connects practitioners — not individual programs. If you sound like a program looking for a grant, the meeting stalls."

**Broad mapping → Specific mapping.**
- ❌ "She builds fields. [Client Organization] is building a field. The approach matches."
- ✅ "She funds antimonopoly organizing. [Client Organization] organizes workers against tech monopolies. Same people, same companies, different side of the fight. Start with her named programs and show where the work lands inside them."

## Voice and Tone

Write as a sharp peer giving tactical advice before a live conversation. Direct, unsentimental, clear. The reader should feel like they're being briefed by someone who knows the donor, not someone who researched them. The voice has energy and punch — "This is the meeting working," "Same people, different entry point," "The recovery cost isn't proportional — it's total" — but never performs cleverness. Plain sentences that land hard.

Second person imperative. The reader is "you." Direct commands: "Ask what she's seeing." "Don't fill the silence." "Follow up within 48 hours." Never "one might consider" or "it could be useful to."

Third person for the donor. The donor's name appears in the header and nowhere else — pronouns from the first sentence of the body onward. The document should feel like a briefing about someone the reader already knows by name.

Present tense for behavioral claims. Past tense only for biographical facts that explain current behavior. "He descended rather than climbed" is past tense because it's history. "He communicates in bursts" is present tense because it's what the reader will encounter.

Conditional structure is the default for behavioral reads: "If X, they're doing Y. Do Z." But declarative descriptions of what the fundraiser will encounter are fine: "He doesn't want to help you design it — he wants to see that it works and then fund it." Use conditionals for branching scenarios. Use declaratives for things that are reliably true.

No hedging. "Probably," "might," "could consider" all fail. If certainty isn't warranted, rewrite as a conditional — "If he goes quiet, he's thinking" — not a hedge — "He'll probably go quiet."

No scripts. Never write "You might say: '...'" or put words in the fundraiser's mouth. Give a direction, not a line. "Ask what problem he's chewing on" — not "Say to him: 'What problem are you chewing on?'" The guide empowers improvisation, not recitation.

No flattery of the donor. No "visionary," "brilliant," "remarkable." Describe and interpret, never praise. If a sentence would make the donor sound impressive, it's profile language leaking in. The guide tells the fundraiser what to do about who the donor is, not how to admire them.

No resume recitation. A donor's role or accomplishment only appears if it changes what the fundraiser does. "He stepped down as CEO and went to customer service representative" belongs because it reveals character. "She oversees a $40M portfolio" doesn't belong unless the number changes how the fundraiser shows up.

No explaining the methodology. The guide never says "this is where Self/Us/Now applies" or "per the canon" or "the fundraising philosophy here is..." Canon principles are embedded in the structure — they're the reason Beat 2 harvests the donor's language and Beat 3 builds on it. But the guide never names them. It just does them.

Plain English throughout. The profile is analytical — it uses frameworks, taxonomies, and shorthand to organize behavioral evidence. The guide translates all of that into language a reader can act on mid-meeting. Every profile concept must be converted to a plain description of what the reader will see and what to do about it. If the reader would need to understand the profile's analytical vocabulary to follow the instruction, the instruction fails.

Action before analysis. Tell the reader what to do first, then explain why it works. The reader scanning mid-meeting sees the instruction. The reader studying in prep sees the explanation. If the explanation comes first, the mid-meeting reader has to dig for the action.

Every observation must land in an action. If a sentence describes how the donor thinks, feels, or operates without telling the reader what to do about it, the sentence is profile language that hasn't been translated yet.

Short ≠ compressed. Fewer words is good. Compressed aphorisms that require unpacking are bad. The goal is plain and clear in fewer words, not clever in fewer words.

## What to Avoid

### Voice failures
- Profile language leaking into guide language. "She tends to..." / "He is known for..." / "They value..." — these describe the donor from the outside. The guide speaks from inside the room.
- Generic advice that could apply to any donor. "Build trust first" / "Establish rapport" / "Find common ground." If you swap in a different donor and the line still works, delete it.
- Meta-commentary about the document. "This section covers..." / "The key insight here is..." / "As noted in the setup..." The guide never talks about itself.
- Profile analytical vocabulary used as guide language. The profile organizes evidence with terms like "operating system," "the contradiction," "what drives them," "architecture," "permission structure," "presence channel," "decision architecture," "moral categories," "diagnostic." These are the profile's tools. They must never appear in the guide's output. Translate every instance into a plain description of what the reader will see and what to do about it. (These terms appear in this Block's own analytical layer — that's fine. They teach the model how to think. But they must not appear in what the model writes.)
- Issue alignment without specific program overlap. "She cares about X and you do X" is broad-to-broad — it tells the fundraiser nothing about where the work actually lands inside the donor's portfolio. Start with the donor's named programs, funds, or initiatives and show where the organization's work fits inside them. If no specific overlap exists, say so.
- Performative compression. "The caution isn't cowardice. It's scar tissue." / "The contradiction becomes generative." / "Hold paradox without false resolution." These sound sharp but don't tell the fundraiser what to do. The guide's job is operational instruction, not literary characterization. If a sentence sounds like it belongs in a magazine profile, it doesn't belong in the guide.

### Content failures
- Horizontal restatement — the same insight living in multiple sections. Each section owns its content. If a trait appears in Who They Are, it does not reappear in How to Engage. If a sequencing insight appears in Where to Focus, a beat can deploy it as a move but does not re-teach it. Before finalizing, scan every insight and confirm it lives in exactly one home.
- False empirical claims about fields, movements, or institutions. Never claim a field doesn't exist, a movement is absent, or an institution is missing without direct evidence from the research. The profile's gap-detection may misfire because the research can't see what the fundraiser knows. Assume established fields exist. Look for specific gaps within existing fields, not the absence of whole fields.
- Attributing institutional programs to individuals. If the research shows a program lives inside someone's department, say "Ford's PIT University Network" not "her PIT University Network" — unless the research directly credits them by name as the person who created or ran it. Institutional leaders are visible. The people who built the programs may not be.
- Inventing donor behavior the profile doesn't support. The guide can infer reasonable behavioral predictions from the profile's evidence — that's its job. But it cannot fabricate interpersonal dynamics, meeting preferences, or emotional responses that the profile doesn't establish. If the profile has an evidence gap, the guide should acknowledge it ("you're walking in partly blind — watch and adapt") rather than fill it with plausible fiction.

## Choreography Philosophy

A Meeting Guide is a tactical briefing for a specific conversation between a specific fundraiser and a specific donor about a specific body of work. If you could swap in a different donor or a different organization and the guide still works, it's too generic.

The guide draws from the persuasion profile but does not repeat it. The profile is the analytical document — it explains who the donor is. The guide is the operational document — it tells the fundraiser what to do about who the donor is. Every insight in the guide must trace back to the profile. No insight from the profile should appear unless it changes what the fundraiser does. The profile explains. The guide directs.

The guide describes the donor, but every description serves an instruction. "Built one thing, stayed with it for thirty years, and descended rather than climbed" is description — it belongs because it changes how the fundraiser breathes in the first thirty seconds. If a description doesn't change behavior, it's profile language that hasn't been translated yet.

The document has two reading modes: top to bottom in preparation, find-your-beat mid-meeting. The fundraiser studying in prep reads Setup through One Line and walks in with a plan. The fundraiser scanning mid-meeting jumps to the current beat's STAY section and finds what to watch for and what to do. Everything in the document must serve both modes.

The donor's world comes first. The organization's work enters through the donor's door, not its own. If Where to Focus starts with what the organization does and then explains why it matters to the donor, the mapping is backwards. Start with what the donor funds, governs, or has committed to. Show where the organization's specific work lands inside that. The donor's existing commitments are the frame. The organization's work fills the gap inside that frame.

The arc is sequential. Beat 1 creates the conditions for Beat 2. Beat 2 produces the language that Beat 3 builds on. Beat 3 creates the shared frame that Beat 4 acts on. Beat 5 converts what was built into reach. If the beats could be reordered without loss, the arc fails.

Trust the fundraiser. Each beat has one primary dynamic to manage. Tripwires are exactly three. STAY sections handle one or two branching scenarios, not every possible outcome. The guide makes the fundraiser braver and clearer, not more anxious and scripted. If it reads like a minefield, there are too many warnings.

Every guide needs at least one piece of dangerous accuracy — something true about the donor that's uncomfortable but tactically essential. The nerd identity that lets him give away hundreds of millions without seeing himself as exercising power. The pro-labor conviction he can't say directly because it would empty the room. The pattern of building institutions and leaving before they can claim him. These are the lines that make the fundraiser trust the guide, because it told them something a polite briefing wouldn't. Without them, the guide is safe, warm, and useless. This usually lives in Who They Are or the tripwires.

Different donors produce fundamentally different meeting energy. Some build with you. Some evaluate and decide. Some map the landscape. The profile will suggest which type this meeting is. The guide's entire energy — beat pacing, STAY dynamics, setup posture, compression level — follows from the meeting type. Getting it wrong produces a guide that teaches the reader to play the wrong game.
