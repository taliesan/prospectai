## THE DONOR READ

**POSTURE**

**He moved his family to Wisconsin to knock doors because the data said it might matter. He's not an analyst watching from a safe distance — he's someone who commits with his whole life when the evidence points to action.**
Arrive with a problem worth that kind of person's time. Not a deck. Not a vision. A live experiment where the outcome is uncertain and the stakes are real. Be more transparent than you'd normally be — share your actual numbers, your failures, your internal debates. He published his entire fund's operating manual open-source. Opacity reads as a mismatch in operating style. Bring a shared contact if you have one — someone from the labor or organizing world who can frame the introduction intellectually, not just warmly.

**WHAT LIGHTS THEM UP**

- **Ask for his help building something specific.**
  His deepest identity is enabler. He treats founders as customers — inverts the power dynamic so the person who needs capital is the person he serves. When you genuinely ask him to make you better at something, he shifts from evaluating to building.
- **Show what you've tested and what failed. Share the numbers.**
  He evaluates by falsification and builds trust through radical transparency. He quotes specific returns ("93 millionaires," "$75M returned"). Match his information density. Unguarded data earns his trust faster than polished narrative.
- **Surface a cross-domain connection he hasn't seen.**
  He teaches both media and organized labor at Berkeley — "seemingly unrelated fields" he uses to test theories about power and technology. If you can show him where the client's issue area connects to something outside his existing frame — game theory, platform economics, municipal governance — he registers you as someone who thinks the way he does.
- **Frame the moment as an inflection point with a closing window.**
  He focuses on transition periods — 'the knee of the curve.' When something feels like it's about to change and there's a narrow window for action, his attention locks and his commitment deepens.

**WHAT SHUTS THEM DOWN**

- **Ideological assertion without evidence. He arrived at pro-labor through investigation, not politics. Assume shared methodology, not shared ideology.**
- **Wasting his time with information he could find himself. He calls this a sin — literally.**
- **Guarded or polished self-presentation. If you're vague about your budget, failure rate, or internal tensions, he'll read you as someone who doesn't operate the way he does.**
- **Pitching a fixed plan instead of a testable hypothesis. He funds iteration, not certainty.**

**THEY'LL READ YOU AS** · Another nonprofit asking a VC to write a check. Establish quickly that you think in systems, run experiments, and share information freely — that you operate the way his best founders do. Don't build personal rapport. Build intellectual rapport. This relationship deepens through shared work, not warmth.

**AUTHORSHIP THEY NEED** · Intellectual and structural, but in service mode. He needs to see the gap, propose how to test through it, and feel that his contribution made you more capable. The whole meeting should feel like he's helping you build something — not like you're trying to get his approval. When he starts sketching, stop talking. When he names who you should meet, write it down visibly.

**IF THIS COLLAPSES TO 5 MIN:** *Name one testable hypothesis about the client's issue area at a closing inflection point — AI displacement, new economy precarity, post-Dobbs labor surge — and show why the window matters now. Ask if you can send him the diligence and get thirty minutes of his reaction. Low-commitment, high-learning. That's how he enters.*

## THE ALIGNMENT MAP

**PRIMARY TERRITORY**

**He runs the only venture fund focused on the future of work. [Client Organization] is building the worker-power infrastructure for that future. He's funding one side of the equation — [Client Organization] is funding the other.**
This isn't charity alignment. It's portfolio logic. Bloomberg Beta invests in companies that reshape how work happens. [Client Organization] invests in organizations that ensure workers have power as that reshaping occurs. He already chairs the Aspen roundtable on organized labor, invested in Union, teaches labor at Berkeley. You're not asking him to care about a new cause — you're showing him the missing piece of a system he's already building.

**SECONDARY TERRITORIES**

- **The testing gap in labor philanthropy.**
  Traditional labor funding is ideological, not experimental. [Client Organization]'s portfolio approach — seeding EWOC, backing new organizing models, funding infrastructure — mirrors how Bloomberg Beta deploys capital. If he asks 'what's different about you,' this is the answer.
- **AI and worker power at the knee of the curve.**
  Workers in AI-adjacent industries need organizing infrastructure now, before the transformation is complete. This is his investment thesis applied to a different asset class. The window language will register — he thinks in inflection points, not steady states.
- **Dignity as a design requirement, not a sentiment.**
  He says what workers want is 'to be needed' and 'to belong.' That's not emotion — it's his framework for what any system serving workers must deliver. When the systems conversation has earned enough trust, there's a moment to drop in one specific human story — an organizer, a worker who gained agency. He leads with economics but what moves him is human capacity. Earn the moment, then use it.

**FIGHT OR BUILD** · **Open Build.** He's a designer, not a prosecutor. Lead with what you're constructing and where you're stuck. But if he names the threat himself — corporate consolidation, AI displacement, democratic erosion — follow him into Fight. Let him initiate the frame switch. He'll trust it more if it was his idea.

**HANDS ON THE WHEEL** · **Testing partner and connector who serves by making you more capable.** He doesn't want a title. He wants to pressure-test your hypotheses, connect you to specific people in his network, and see whether your model actually works. The highest-value next step may be experiential — he built his labor convictions at Labor Notes, in rooms with organizers. Put him in a room with EWOC organizers or a live campaign. That's how he learns. That's how he commits.

## THE MEETING ARC

*Try not to meet at Bloomberg Beta — a coffee shop or a walk gets the intellectual explorer, not the fund manager. The meeting starts in the small talk: reference something he's recently written or taught, as genuine engagement, not flattery. Don't open with your material — frame it as shared work: 'We're wrestling with something and want to think it through with you.' You're not taking turns. You're picking up what he puts down and building from inside it. If time gets short, skip content to protect the arc. Always land a next step.*

| THE MOVE | THE READ |
|----------|----------|
| **1 · GET THEM TALKING** | |
| **Ask what experiment or investment is teaching him the most right now about what's coming for workers. Not your framing — his. Let him answer with a framework. Then ask what it connects to that he didn't expect.** | If he names a specific company, campaign, or cross-domain tension, he's present. If he gives polished future-of-work language, he's screening — ask a follow-up that requires data he hasn't published. |
| **2 · LET THEM NAME THE STAKES** | |
| **Ask what happens to workers in his portfolio companies' industries if organizing infrastructure doesn't exist in five years. Don't say 'movement.' Don't say 'justice.' Let him arrive at the stakes in his own language. Then wait. Don't fill the silence — he's a thinker. If you rush to reframe, you'll get the analytical answer. If you wait, you might get the real one.** | Whatever framing he uses — 'demand destruction,' 'institutional vacuum' — adopt it. But listen for the shift underneath: if he starts talking about agency, belonging, people being needed — not as emotion but as design criteria — that's him telling you what he actually cares about. Follow it. |
| **3 · COMBINE YOUR WORLDS** | |
| **Bridge from his framing — credit his language when you connect it to the work. Then: 'We're testing whether philanthropic capital can do for worker organizing what venture does for startups — absorb early risk, prove models, then leverage larger pools. Here's where we're stuck.' Share real constraints — your budget, your failure rate, what's actually hard. When he starts redesigning, don't defend. Say 'that's the part we haven't solved.' As the shared picture takes shape, name the full scope: this is going to take expertise, partners, and resources to build. Make money part of the emerging design, not a separate ask.** | If he's asking operational questions with numbers, he's inside the frame. If he starts redesigning — sketching, mapping, building out loud — make it physical. Get something on paper between you. Build it together. Credit what he's adding — he needs to feel his contribution made you more capable. If he starts naming people, he's past evaluation into service mode. If he shifts from systems to human language — agency, dignity, belonging — that's your window for one specific story. A worker, an organizer. Earned, not performed. If you brought a one-pager or portfolio map, walk through it together now — don't hand it off to speak for itself. |
| **4 · PRESS PLAY** | |
| **He commits gradually, not all at once. Think side-project scale: 'Can I send you our diligence on one specific campaign and get thirty minutes of your reaction?' Or experiential: 'We're bringing [specific people] to meet organizers in [specific city] — want to come?' Frame the next step as the first iteration of an ongoing experiment. He escalates on his own terms.** | If he proposes a different next step, take it — he's telling you how he commits. If he offers to connect you to someone specific, that's more than politeness. If he says 'let me think about it,' that's honest, not a brush-off. He means it. If he's deep in a design problem — redesigning your model, working through a constraint — don't break the thread to force a close. The design session is the relationship. The next step will be obvious when you get there. |
| **5 · UNLOCK THE NETWORK** | |
| **'Who in your portfolio or your Aspen roundtable should be seeing what we're seeing?' Name a specific sector or problem — not 'who else cares about workers.' Write names down visibly — on paper between you. Make the list a shared artifact.** | Unprompted introductions are commitment. Naming a specific person with context — 'you need to talk to X because Y' — is even stronger. Follow up on every name within 48 hours. If he gives you three names and you follow up on two, he'll register the dropped one as exactly the kind of waste he calls a sin. |

## READING THE ROOM

| WORKING | STALLING |
|---------|----------|
| Redesigning your approach out loud. Asking operational questions with numbers. Referencing his portfolio, Aspen, or Berkeley work. Using 'we.' Naming specific people you should meet. Offering to falsify an assumption. Shifting from systems to human language — agency, belonging, dignity as design criteria. Sketching or building something with you physically. | Polished future-of-work talking points. Googleable questions. Complimenting the mission without engaging the model. Staying in 'you' language. Pleasant analytical distance. Advising rather than designing — telling you what to do instead of solving it with you. |

**RESET MOVES**

- **If he goes abstract, go granular.** Name a specific campaign, a specific failure, a specific cost. Unit economics of a union drive will re-engage a VC faster than narrative.
- **If he's advising instead of designing, hand him a real constraint.** 'We can't do X because Y — how would you solve that?' He can't resist an unsolved problem with real parameters. That's the move that flips him from audience to architect.
- **If he gets skeptical about legacy labor, agree completely.** 'That's exactly why we exist. The old model doesn't iterate. Here's what the new one looks like.' He funded Union for the same reason. Don't defend institutions he's already critiqued — show him you're building the replacement.
