Democracy Takes Work (DTW) organizes philanthropic resources to support a strong labor
movement, on the theory that working class institutions are a cornerstone of a healthy
democracy. We are growing a community of individual donors and philanthropic partners to
generate new resources in support of worker organizing, with the audacious but necessary goal
of 30% union density.


The Broad-Based Benefits of an Organized Working Class
Underlying the many challenges we face as a nation is the erosion of civil society and the
institutions that create opportunities for community, shared decision-making, and agency.
Unions have historically been a powerful vehicle for people to have a voice in their workplace
and beyond. They have been the foundation of broad, progressive social change, advocating
not just for their own members but for policies that benefit everyone. And they are social spaces
that can work against polarization and increase democratic participation.

Studies show that:
- There is an inverse relationship between union density and economic inequality. When
union density was at its height of 35% in the mid-1900s, economic inequality was at its
lowest. The reverse is also true: with union density now at about 10%, economic
inequality is the highest it's been since the Great Depression.
- States with higher union density have higher voter turnout and increase political
participation more generally.
- Right to work laws decrease Democratic vote share by 3.5 percentage points.
- States with lower density have lower turnout, fewer working class candidates in state
legislatures and congress, and more conservative policy.
- States with lower density have higher infant mortality rates, higher overdose and suicide
deaths, and lower wages and incomes.
- Unions promote racial equity by reducing wage gaps and protecting workers from
discrimination but also by reducing racial resentment in white workers.
- Women represented by unions earn 4.7% more than their non union counterparts.
- Unionized workplaces are associated with higher job satisfaction and wellbeing among
workers, both key ingredients for attracting and retaining top talent.
- In some industries, such as education and construction, unions have been found to
increase productivity. Although specific effects on productivity vary by industry,
researchers do not find negative effects of unionization on productivity overall.


Challenges and Opportunities
We are navigating difficult terrain. In order to achieve 30% density, labor law must be
significantly reformed to broaden the pathways for workers to unionize, a daunting proposition in
the near term. The economy is also in the process of transformation: as the adoption of artificial
intelligence alters what jobs are necessary, workers face increased precarity. Furthermore, not
all unions are unequivocally committed to fighting for their workers, or broader progressive
political outcomes. We are at a moment of significant change in this arena.

However, we are encouraged by a number of tailwinds. Demand for labor unions is high: 48% of
non-union workers say they would like to join a union. Public support for the labor movement is
at its highest level since 1965, with 71% of Americans expressing support for unions and 75%
supporting workers going on strike for higher wages and benefits. In 2023, surveys indicated
that 60 million people wanted to join a union.

Workers are also self organizing for more economic and political rights. Some are initiating new
organizing activity without the help of legacy labor unions, while others are working to reform
their institutions from within. And they are experimenting with new models and methods: as
worker unrest and militancy is rising, labor leadership is publicly calling for high profile strikes
and mobilizations in the coming years. Now is a crucial time to support worker-led efforts to
unionize and organize, so that working class people can have power and voice in setting the
terms of the next economy.


Our Strategy
DTW will support worker organizing through three strategies, all of which aim to catalyze
increased investment into the project of rebuilding the power of working people in America:

1. Funding Worker-led Organizations and Campaigns

The last few years have been animated by an upsurge in labor unrest, especially in the form of
new union organizing, whether at Amazon or Trader Joe's or professional sports leagues. At the
same time, foundations have been largely unable or unwilling to fund these efforts, and many
unions have been too risk averse to offer their unmitigated support for these worker-led efforts.

Strategically targeted philanthropic and donor support can absorb the early stage risk inherent
in new worker organizing, demonstrate what's possible, and then leverage the larger pools of
capital necessary to eventually achieve 30% density. We will raise a fund, housed at the
Amalgamated Foundation, and can also advise donors to give in an aligned fashion. We
suggest funding through the following categories.

1.1 Infrastructure for New and Independent Worker Organizing
Regardless of the particular campaign, there are a set of distinct capacities new organizing
campaigns typically require in order to succeed. Outside support is generally crucial throughout
the course of the campaign, from winning union recognition to getting a first contract.

Campaigns can look for this from legacy unions if they choose to affiliate, or non-profits led by
experienced union organizers if they are not ready to affiliate - which is where philanthropic
funding is particularly useful. Needed supports includes:
- Training on the steps of a union drive, e.g. how to organize their peers, and the process
of unionization. Training programs can also equip "salts" - workers who then take jobs at
designated companies with the intention of unionizing. Starbucks, for example, was
organized by salts.
- Advice and coaching on campaign strategy and tactics along the way. This takes shape
in the form of ongoing support of experienced organizers who can help navigate the
specifics of a campaign.
- Technological support for email systems, small dollar fundraising, and the digital
components of campaigns.
- Media and communications support.

Additionally, in cases where workers may be threatened or fired because of their organizing,
funds that provide a cushion against retaliation can enable more courageous action.

Examples of infrastructure groups in these categories include: Emergency Workplace
Organizing Committee; Workers Winning/Action Network; Inside Organizer School; Sports
Solidarity and Fired Up Fund. Several other organizations that aim to help with this pipeline for
organizing are currently in the process of being established, which we are tracking closely.

1.2. Unionization Campaigns in Strategic Industries
There are currently numerous unionization campaigns under way. We plan to support 3-5
campaigns that have the potential to reach significant scale, in partnership with unions that are
committed to new organizing. Philanthropic support can move through:
- Community partners who help advocate for workers and unionization efforts
- Local unions who manage 501(c)3 vehicles
- Communications and media strategies to increase public support

Given our focus on the intersection of worker power and democracy, we are researching
campaigns in high relevance/battleground states and metro areas on a 2032 map, through
ongoing conversations with community and labor leaders.

1.3 Innovations in Worker Organizing
To achieve 30% density, we understand that steady steps will need to be punctuated by leaps in
progress. We anticipate that under a hostile administration, workers will organize and mobilize in
creative and innovative ways. We're tracking efforts such as:
- Experiments that do not require the approval or involvement of the National Labor
Relations Board, e.g. the recent ballot measure in Massachusetts that is enabling Lyft
and Uber drivers to unionize.
- Sectoral bargaining opportunities that set wage floors and protections through direct
negotiations with high-leverage employers.
- Innovative financing mechanisms to create revolving loan funds, addressing the
limitations of 501(c)(3)s in this space.

We are also considering a RFP for ideas to catalyze organizing in the face of economic
transformation (e.g. leveraging AI for new organizing).


2. Advocacy for Working Class Institution-Building and Unlocking Resources

We know that the funding needed to reach 30% density is significant. That's why we will
approach our grantmaking as a catalyst, in hopes to inspire others. A relatively modest
investment can be leveraged to generate further financing and to push existing institutions to be
more engaged and effective.

Part of this involves advocacy to encourage unions to match our grantmaking and to
commit more of their resources to new worker organizing. Unions currently have significant
assets that they can use for more organizing, but they are not being strategically deployed. We
believe we can solve a pipeline problem to de-risk and unlock some of these resources.

We will also want to organize within the progressive and political networks of advocacy
organizations to make the rebuilding of the labor movement, and the increase of union density,
a priority across the board. We will work with think tanks, non-profits, beltway organizations and
media institutions to focus on this as a crucial part of the pathway to a more equitable and
sustainable future.


3. Organizing within Philanthropy

Philanthropy has not been strongly aligned with the labor movement in recent times, with
notable exceptions. DTW was incubated in one of the rare spaces that brings these disparate
actors together -- the Democracy Alliance, and further developed in collaboration with Solidaire
Network, Way to Win, and Movement Voter Project. In partnership with these networks, DTW is
building a cohort of donors and funders that will learn, organize, and fund collectively.
Since we began building this community in the late summer of 2024, we have had a number of
virtual events and we plan to organize a series of virtual and in person events in 2025 that will
feature worker leaders, organizers, union heads, academics, journalists, and more. This cohort
of funders will function as an organizing committee that can in turn recruit their own networks to
increase investment in worker power. We anticipate this community growing to at least 50 new
donors and foundations who are committed to supporting worker power in 2025.

While our grantmaking will be driven through our pooled giving strategy, other opportunities for
funding, advocacy, and even campaigns may emerge organically from this community and we
will also invite aligned giving.

+++++

Given current social, economic and political conditions, the upcoming period should be spent
planting the seeds and nurturing the campaigns that can put us on the path to rebuild a strong
middle class in America, to give workers more agency and control over their own lives, to
address massive economic inequality, and to counter reactionary and anti-democratic appeals
aimed at working class Americans. We believe increasing union density to 30% is a key part of
the pathway to a brighter future. DTW will fund the organizations, movements, and ideas that
illuminate the pathway there.


Democracy Takes Work (DTW) - Who we are

Why We Exist
Democracy Takes Work (DTW) supports working people to achieve economic stability and build
durable power through their own collective action and organizing, as an antidote to
authoritarianism and concentrated corporate power.
Historically and across the globe, solidarity among working people has been uniquely effective
to end authoritarian regimes and political education. Our society was at its strongest when at
least 30% of working people were organized into a union. Today, union density is down to just
10%, which has left democratic institutions vulnerable. We need to urgently close the gap.
From professors to janitors, from coders to baristas - DTW supports all people at work to build,
activate, and institutionalize lasting, collective power.
Working people are the protagonists of social change that empowers us all.
Mission: We support working people to achieve economic stability and build durable power
through collective action and organizing, as an antidote to authoritarianism and concentrated
corporate power.
Vision: People organized at work hold the most power over our own lives.
North Star: At least 30% of working people are meaningfully affiliated with a democratic,
self-sufficient worker organization that flexes durable economic, political, and social power.

What guides us
These guidelines anchor DTW's strategy, decision-making, and relationships. They help us
navigate disagreements, set priorities, and model transparency and collective decision-making
within our team.
- Working people at the center: We set the stage and strengthen infrastructure for
unions and worker-led formations that are capable of wielding real power. From
scientists to landscapers, from nurses to bus drivers; we believe working people know
best what they need.
- Solidarity across movements: We are one part of a broad coalition in the fight against
authoritarianism and consolidated corporate power. Working people are also in the
movements for climate justice, racial equity, gender justice, and economic fairness. We
are all in this together.
- Experimentation and risk-taking with purpose: We embrace bold ideas and move
quickly and strategically for outsized impact in moments that matter. We leverage
moments of public attention to build our case. We know failure is a feature of
innovation.

What we are building
We support working people who are organizing to build and flex strategic economic, political
and social power. Our goal is to catalyze:
- No gap between philanthropy and the fight: We connect with donors to move
significant institutional resources quickly to the groundwork. We treat supporters,
donors, grantees, and labor allies as partners - not ATMs, not service providers, not
free labor, not gatekeepers.
- Deeper field capacity: We expand the definition of "organizer" and equip more working
people with the skills and tools needed for organizing people, whether paid or volunteer.
- Worker-led democratic formations: We seed and scale organizations that can be
self-sustaining, accountable to members, and effective in wielding collective power.

How we work:
- We make decisions as transparently as possible and with integrity and care. We
socialize the need for worker power, welcome new contributors at every level, and
cultivate a learning community that closes the gap between workers and people who
support them.
- We want the short-term, visible wins, but we also know there will be big non-linear
leaps forward, as well as incremental gains toward durable power for the long haul. We
balance smart opportunism with rigor.
- We are ecosystemic. While we honor labor's history, we also advocate for innovation.
We critique silos and exclusivity, and pursue bold, scalable experiments. We stay
honest about what is and isn't working.


Phase I: Foundational Leadership (March 2025)

Why This Matters
As we stand on the precipice of fascism and oligarchy, there is an urgent
need to mobilize the power an organized working class can wield, in
alignment with public servants and the professional class, both in
resistance and in rebuilding for the future.

We've come together to radically expand support for worker-led
organizations and a 21st century labor movement - for the sake of our
democracy and our planet.

The Emerging Strategy
We face a classic strategic challenge: how to start moving, now, without
knowing everything the next four years (and decades!) will hold. The best
way forward is to phase the work, balancing short-term progress with
building long-term power.

While the ground is changing quickly, we do know that our work will
require dynamic, passionate, and capable leadership. This will be the
focus of our first set of investments: strengthening the organizations that
are leading critical work while a more comprehensive strategy comes
together.

Launching the Work
We are launching an initial $10M investment campaign to strengthen the
organizations and individuals leading three key areas.

1) Existing Fights & Pivotal Wins
Nothing is more consequential than supporting the worker-led efforts
currently underway. They are the proving ground for labor's ability to build
power, capture the public imagination, and secure initial victories. We will
focus on two communities under attack by the administration: federal
workers and higher education.

Target Efforts:
Federal Unionist Network (FUN): FUN is an independent network of
members from multiple federal labor unions. Federal workers have been
the first target of DOGE in its push to weaken public power. FUN has
been leading the resistance, organizing days of action across the country,
telling the stories of workers who are fighting back, and absorbing
hundreds of new members, as people reach out to them daily. They are a
central and highly leveraged node in the fight to protect public power and
the efficacy of government.

Labor 4 Higher Ed: The Trump administration is exerting power over
universities by cutting funding and threatening student movements with
legal action. Recent arrests on campuses represent a dangerous attack
on free speech and the rights of legal residents. Two organizations, AAUP
and HELU, have come together to coordinate faculty and student union
members to wage a coordinated campaign of resistance, defend the
power and role of universities to drive public discourse, and protect critical
scientific and medical research, a loss that will weaken us as a country.

2) Tech & Communications Infrastructure
Labor tech is behind other fields. Existing platforms are designed for
advocacy rather than labor organizing. The popular tools are overseen by
corporations ill-equipped for the legal, privacy, and security needs of the
moment. We also want to invest in and promote technologies that can be
worker- and union-owned.

Similarly, we have been losing the culture war to an organized network of
social media influencers, podcasters, and right wing news outlets. The
last decade has seen a concerted effort to wield broadly popular
narratives around strength, solidarity, and shared financial gain to
advance the interests of authoritarian oligarchs. Effective
communications, media, and messaging efforts will be critical to our goal
of achieving 30% labor density in the United States.

Target Efforts:
Labor Tech Development Sprint: We will convene leading
technologists, researchers and practitioners from existing labor
technology communities and groups who are doing adjacent work, for a
rapid analysis and initial deployment of technologies that can support
secure, distributed organizing. This will include public platforms and
onramps for bringing in new potential members, features that support
secure vetting and onboarding at scale, multiple kinds of communications
and collaboration tools (e.g. one-to-one, one-to-many, groups of groups),
and budgeting and fundraising tools.

"Inclusive Economic Populism" Messaging Hub: Organizations
including More Perfect Union are coming together to develop, test,
package, and share messaging that can be used across the movement to
amplify worker-led campaigns, expose employer union-busting tactics,
and shape the narrative around economic justice and corporate
misconduct in America. Their work reaches millions of people, driving
national attention to key strikes and organizing drives, making them an
essential force in the fight to rebuild worker power. More Perfect Union is
a progressive media organization using investigative journalism and
cutting-edge video storytelling to build power for working people.

3) Rapid Experimentation & Organizing
Decades of attacks by corporate interests and anti-union administrations
have reduced union membership to its lowest level since the 1950s.
However, tens of thousands of workers stand ready to be organized.
There are a number of urgent questions around the best way to rebuild
our strength:
- How do we engage new workers (absorption) at an unprecedented rate?
- How do we build wall-to-wall, middle- and working-class, cross-industry solidarity?
- Which worker- or union-led organizing models are the best suited to this moment?

Our work under this priority will consist of investing in labor organizations
and unions currently taking on these questions, while convening a
working group of leaders to identify and experiment with new approaches.

Target Efforts:
Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee (EWOC): EWOC is a
volunteer network and organizing hub that emerged out of the COVID
pandemic to pioneer distributed and digital support for increased
worker-led organizing. A joint effort between union, political and civil
society, EWOC has been central to seeding hundreds of new organizing
campaigns and successful wins in retail, service industry, nonprofits and
more. Their decentralized, peer-to-peer training and one-to-one support
for organizing model provide an important path to rapidly increase
participation in the labor movement - by empowering workers to lead their
own efforts, with scalable support from seasoned organizers.

Organizing and Mass Absorption Strategy Group: As part of our effort
to create a mid- and long-term investment strategy, we are going to
convene a working group of labor leaders and technologists to assess the
question of rapid organizing and growth.

Investment Campaign: Achieving 30% union density - Democracy Takes
Work's long-term mission - will require resources well beyond the current
scope of institutional philanthropy. We are launching an effort to expand
investment in labor via a series of escalating, public-facing investment
large- and small-dollar fundraising efforts. To inform our investment
thesis, we are working with longtime advisors and experts within labor to
identify opportunities in specific industries; understand legal conditions in
key states; map union finances and current union organizing plans; and
identify innovative experiments that can augment and underpin the
movement.

Phase I Budget:
- Existing Fights & Pivotal Wins: $4M (FUN + Labor 4 Higher Ed)
- Tech & Communications Infrastructure: $3M (Labor Tech Sprint + Messaging Hub)
- Rapid Experimentation & Organizing: $3M (EWOC + Strategy Group + Investment Campaign)
- Total: $10M


Phase II: Investing, Fighting, Building

1. Investing where organizing grows power
Strategic purpose: Direct resources to the organizing efforts and local experiments that
expand labor's base of strength - bringing new workers into the movement, winning
bread-and-butter fights, and proving that unions matter in everyday life.
- Fund campaigns in leverage sectors - tech, finance, healthcare, academia - where
workplace organizing can grow density and shift economic and political power.
- Support geographic pilots in places like North Carolina and Michigan that link
workplace organizing to community health and political strength.
- Invest in experiments that connect organizing to material conditions on wages,
inflation, and cost of living to show unions deliver tangible improvements.
- Partner with mutual aid efforts and community leaders to circulate resources within
communities and tie labor's work directly to people's needs.
- Develop pathways for emerging organizers to lead and represent the movement's
next generation.

2. Supporting working people in the fight against authoritarianism
Strategic purpose: Back worker-driven, comprehensive campaigns that challenge
concentrated corporate and political power, defend workers and communities from authoritarian
assaults, and position the labor movement as a central force for democratic renewal.
- Champion labor victories in real time through press, public affairs, and narrative
interventions that demonstrate: "labor power is my power."
- Turn workplace fights into national stories that show unions defending democracy,
advancing climate action, and protecting human rights.
- Mobilize youth, students, and culturally visible workers to play visible roles in
campaigns that inspire and expand labor's profile.
- Launch a speakers and events strategy to elevate worker voices, convene public
forums, and stage high-profile moments where labor leads the national conversation.
- Pair public campaigns with research and analysis that demonstrate labor's potential
to reshape the balance of power in this moment.

3. Strengthening the leadership and tools behind the movement
Strategic purpose: Sustain the infrastructure that allows organizing and campaigns to grow
and endure - ensuring today's resurgence of worker power has the leadership, tools, and
resources it needs to scale.
- Sustain worker-led leadership pipelines through EWOC, student chapters, and
training initiatives that continually seed new campaigns and organizers.
- Resource independent organizing tools such as secure collaboration and
communication platforms that sit outside corporate control.
- Fund narrative and research platforms that keep labor active in the news cycle and
central to public discourse.
- Support local resource mobilization to help communities generate and circulate
funding for their own campaigns.
- Develop durable national investment vehicles - member dues models, small-dollar
engines, giving circles, donor networks, and affinity groups - to provide reliable funding
at scale.
