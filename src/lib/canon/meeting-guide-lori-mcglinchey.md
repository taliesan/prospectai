## MEETING GUIDE — LORI McGLINCHEY

---

### SETUP

**Who They Are.**
- Career grantmaker — thirty years inside two foundations. Her identity is the institutional role itself. No personal brand, no thought-leadership blog, no keynote speeches. When she speaks publicly, she says "we." The authority comes from the portfolio, not the person.
- She doesn't fund projects — she funds fields. Every initiative follows the same structure: identify a gap, convene a coalition, build shared infrastructure, fund the ecosystem that emerges. The Table ran eight years. The PIT University Network is 48 schools deep. She thinks in decades.
- Before the policy career, she was a cultural worker — Yiddish Book Center, an NPR radio series on Eastern European Jewish literature. Someone who spent her mid-twenties producing radio about Yiddish fiction has aesthetic and humanistic instincts that the institutional role completely conceals.

**How to Engage.**
- This is an institutional partnership exploration, not a fundraising ask. Treat her as a field architect evaluating where your work fits in something she's been building for a decade.
- Lead with the ecosystem, not with your organization. Show her you know the field she's built — who's in it, what's missing, where you fit. If you approach without awareness of her existing portfolio, you're asking her to evaluate you without context.
- Name your gaps honestly. She publicly said Ford was "missing a very significant component of civil rights" by excluding disability from its technology work — then built a fund to fix it. She respects the gap acknowledged more than the gap concealed.

**Where to Focus.**
- Lead with **Organize** framed as the missing labor dimension of her existing antimonopoly work. Ford's Antimonopoly Fund is built on the principle that concentrated power needs distributed counter-power. The workers inside monopoly supply chains — Amazon warehouses, gig platforms, contracted tech labor — have no organized voice in the fight she's already funding.
- Ground it in **Fight** through the technology lens — AI displacement, algorithmic management, workplace surveillance. These land inside her Technology and Society program without translation. The workers being displaced by AI have no seat at the tables where AI governance decisions get made.
- **Innovate** is the movement-tech angle — the entire organizing field depends on corporate-owned tools built by the companies workers are trying to hold accountable. She funded the Spyware Accountability Initiative because people fighting power need tools that aren't controlled by the powerful. The same logic applies to labor.
- Position the work for co-funding from the start. Almost nothing in her portfolio is Ford-only. If you can name which other funders belong at the table and what each would take, you're doing half her job for her.
- Show her that workers govern the work — actually govern it, not just get consulted. Community governance isn't a soft preference in her portfolio. It's structural. If workers aren't in decision-making roles, expect that gap to surface fast.

**Logistics.**
- **Venue:** Her office at Ford is fine — she's institutional and the setting should match. Don't try to pull her out of context.
- **Duration:** Don't expect a single meeting to produce a decision. Her decision architecture is built on accumulated evidence over time. This is the first of several conversations.
- **Who to bring:** Keep it small. In a one-on-one or small group, she's more likely to tell you what she actually thinks. In a larger meeting, you'll get the institutional Ford position. The candid version is where the real work happens.

### THE ARC

**Beat 1: Get Them Talking**

*Get them present as a person, not a title. Until they're speaking from curiosity instead of expertise, nothing else in this conversation will land.*

**START.** Ask what she's thinking about, not what Ford is doing — what's surprised her lately, what's changed in the landscape since she built the current portfolio, what she'd build differently if she were starting now.

**STAY.** You're walking in partly blind — there's almost no public data on how she is in person. Watch and adapt. The shift you're waiting for is when she stops giving the institutional Ford answer and starts telling you what she actually thinks. If she talks about what gaps worry her, what she's learned from grantees that surprised her, where things have failed — that's the person who builds fields, not the person who represents one. If she stays in polished mode, try something closer to the person: the Yiddish literature background, what drew her to this work originally, what the field looks like from inside it after a decade.

**CONTINUE.** When she's thinking as someone who cares about these problems, not as someone who represents Ford — and when there's specificity and energy behind it.

---

**Beat 2: Let Them Name the Stakes**

*Get them to say, in their own words, what they think is broken or at risk. Their language becomes the frame you build on for the rest of the meeting.*

**START.** The workers most affected by monopoly concentration, AI displacement, and surveillance have no organized infrastructure. Does that gap register?

**STAY.** Let her name it. Don't rush to present your solution — let her sit with the gap between her program areas and the workers those programs are supposed to serve. The topics she's most likely to light up on are:

- **The labor gap in her own portfolio** — nobody's building the organizing side of her antimonopoly work. If she connects this to her existing program unprompted, she's already done the mapping for you.
- **AI displacement landing on unorganized workers** — warehouse automation, algorithmic scheduling, AI-driven hiring and firing. Her program exists because technology reproduces inequality when the people affected are excluded from governing it.
- **Movement-tech infrastructure** — workers coordinate on tools owned by the companies they're fighting. There's no movement-owned alternative.

If she starts asking who else is working on this, who else is funding it, how it connects — that's not deflection. That's her evaluating whether a field is ready to be built. Answer with specifics.

If she treats it as a labor issue rather than a tech issue — "that sounds like it belongs with our economic equity colleagues" — bridge through the technology: the displacement is technological, the surveillance is technological, the tools are corporate-owned. The solution is labor, but the problem is tech.

**CONTINUE.** When she names the gap with specificity — connecting it to parts of her program, naming what's missing, or asking how the pieces fit together.

---

**Beat 3: Combine Your Worlds**

*Connect their language to the work. Sketch it together so it becomes theirs. This is where "your project" becomes "our problem."*

**START.** Bridge from her words. Map the specific overlaps between the work and her program — not the whole organization, just the intersections. Present it as emerging, not finished.

**STAY.** Listen for which part of the work she grabs — that tells you where to go deeper:

- **She starts building the map with you** — connecting your work to organizations in her portfolio, suggesting co-funders, naming people you should talk to. Stop pitching. Co-design. She's at her best when she's connecting fields that aren't yet connected.
- **She grabs the coalition architecture** — which foundations fund which pieces, what shared learning looks like, how multiple funders enter the same strategy. She's evaluating whether this can become a field. Give her everything.
- **She grabs the governance question** — who leads the design, which workers, what decision-making structures. This is her most important test. Show her that workers lead. Name specific structures.

When it's stalling: she's evaluating your organization rather than the intersection — budget, team, track record. Offer the hardest unsolved problem in the field instead. Get her designing, not assessing.

**CONTINUE.** When "you" becomes "we." Or when she's asking shaping questions — how it connects to existing grantees, where the co-funding entry points are, what the five-year trajectory looks like.

**Beat 4: Press Play**

*Start the work before the meeting ends. Find something for each of you to do and a reason to come back together.*

**START.** Offer to come back with a map of where the labor dimension touches her program areas and a co-funding framework — a strategy for how the intersection gets built.

**STAY.** Listen for how she wants to move it forward:

- **She names a Ford process** — "submit a concept note" or "let me talk to my colleagues." That's the institutional pathway opening. Take it exactly as she describes it and ask what the concept note should emphasize.
- **She's still mapping** — adding connections, questioning assumptions, building the picture with you. Don't rush to the ask. The mapping is the relationship. The next step will emerge from it.
- **She questions scope** — this is interesting but not clearly within Tech and Society. Ask where it might fit: another program, a cross-program opportunity, a different entry point inside Ford.

**CONTINUE.** When the conversation has grown into something bigger than one meeting. She knows what's happening next — a concept note shaped by what she told you, a connection to a colleague in another program, a co-funder conversation she's going to have. The institutional process is moving.

---

**Beat 5: Unlock the Network**

*Find out who else should be in this conversation. This is where their social capital converts into reach for the work. Protect time for it — it's often where the best leads come from.*

**START.** For her, the network question is the co-funder question. Who's funding the antimonopoly side that should know about the labor dimension. Who's working on AI displacement that should be connected to organizing.

**STAY.** She sits on seven governance boards and knows who's funding what across the entire tech-and-society space. Write everything down.

- **She names foundations with context** — what each cares about, where the overlap is. Ask if an introduction from her would help.
- **She offers to raise it with colleagues at Ford or other foundations** — that's the strongest signal. She's putting institutional credibility behind the work.
- **She names connections outside philanthropy** — universities, governance bodies, civil rights organizations. She's thinking about the full field, not just funding. Follow her mapping.

If she doesn't engage with the coalition question, she may not see the intersection as ready. Close with: what would need to be true for this to be ready for a coalition approach?

**CONTINUE.** End warm. Thank her — especially around whatever she named in Beat 2 that had specificity behind it. Confirm next steps in her language, not yours. Follow up with something concrete within a week.

### TRIPWIRES

**Pitching your organization instead of mapping the field.** *Tell:* she shifts to evaluation mode — budget, team, track record. *Recovery:* offer an unsolved problem in the field instead. Get her designing, not assessing.

**Positioning Ford as sole funder.** *Tell:* she asks who else is at the table, and you don't have an answer. *Recovery:* name the other funders who should be involved and what each would bring, even if the coalition isn't built yet.

**Presenting expert-led work without community governance.** *Tell:* she starts probing who leads the design, who makes decisions, where affected communities sit. *Recovery:* if workers aren't governing the work yet, say so honestly and describe how you're getting there.

---

### ONE LINE

She builds fields, not portfolios — show her the field that's missing and let her design how to fund it.
