*Democracy Takes Work · February 2026 · Internal Use Only*

## THE DONOR READ

**POSTURE**

**She will interview you before you interview her. That's the opening, not the obstacle.**
Arrive with something she hasn't heard framed this way. If you survive three minutes without flinching, she'll decide you're worth the full meeting. She moves fast, interrupts, and makes declarations — match her pace or get left behind. Bring a shared contact if you have one — it makes her less likely to default to interview mode and more likely to show up as herself.

**WHAT LIGHTS THEM UP**

- **Name a structural problem in a system she already suspects is broken.**
  The more specific and unflattering the diagnosis, the more she trusts it. She stops testing and starts building.
- **Demonstrate field knowledge, not talking points.**
  Competence is her love language. Operational detail shifts her from prosecutorial to collaborative. She respects people who prepare for her the way she prepares for her subjects.
- **Give her information she can't get elsewhere.**
  Information is her ultimate resource. Her durable relationships are with people who give her access to worlds she doesn't have other windows into. DTW's deepest currency with her isn't a giving opportunity — it's a source relationship. Worker organizing in tech, from the inside.
- **Show her something genuinely novel about how organizing works.**
  After thirty years of overpromising tech, she still gets excited by real innovation. EWOC's model, digital-first campaigns, AI-era labor strategy — she'll respond to the novelty itself, not just its politics. She was early to the internet for the same reason.

**WHAT SHUTS THEM DOWN**

- **Flattery or organizational accomplishments up front. She's been licked up and down by billionaires. She'll classify you as a pitch.**
- **Hedging or shading the truth, even slightly. She places truth-telling above all relationships — she reported her own mentee to editors. The fundraiser who hedges loses her permanently.**
- **Treating her as a media figure, not a strategic thinker. You'll get the entertaining Kara — anecdotes, not commitment.**
- **Showing up unprepared. She'll collapse the meeting in five minutes.**

**THEY'LL READ YOU AS** · A nonprofit person asking for money. You have 90 seconds to establish you're a strategist running an outsider operation — not a cause with a brochure, not establishment philanthropy with a labor theme. She built her entire career as the outsider inside the system. She trusts people who operate from outside the way she does.

**AUTHORSHIP THEY NEED** · Intellectual and connective, with a patron gear. She doesn't want to design your strategy — she wants to see the gap and tell you who should be in the room. But if she decides you're worth investing in, she shifts from prosecutor to champion — and the bar goes up, not down. Follow through on every introduction, every suggestion. If she connects you to someone and you don't follow up within 48 hours, the relationship cools fast.

**IF THIS COLLAPSES TO 5 MIN:** *Land one insight about worker organizing in tech from the inside — not from a report. Position DTW as an information source she doesn't currently have. Get agreement to a longer conversation. Not the ask — the next meeting.*

## THE ALIGNMENT MAP

**PRIMARY TERRITORY**

**She's spent thirty years documenting how tech companies accumulate power without accountability. DTW's thesis is the structural answer to the story she's already telling.**
Workers organizing at Amazon, in tech, in AI-adjacent industries are the same people whose exploitation she covers. She just hasn't seen them as a portfolio — or had a source inside the organizing itself. The bridge: this isn't charity — it's the institutional counterweight to the problem she narrates. And DTW can give her a window she can't get from her existing networks.

**SECONDARY TERRITORIES**

- **Innovation that actually works.**
  EWOC, worker-led organizing, sectoral bargaining workarounds, AI-era labor models. New approaches to an old problem — she responds to genuine novelty the way she responded to early internet coverage. If she asks 'what's actually different,' this is where you go.
- **Outsider operation, not establishment philanthropy.**
  DTW funds insurgent organizing that legacy institutions can't or won't touch. She built her career doing what institutions wouldn't. If DTW reads as scrappy, strategic, and willing to fail — that's identity alignment, not just issue alignment.
- **Authoritarianism as a live threat.**
  Worker power as democratic infrastructure maps onto her post-Musk political awakening. She has a personal relationship with institutional exclusion deeper than her professional identity — closed doors, constrained paths, power over people who didn't get a vote. If she goes there, follow her.

**FIGHT OR BUILD** · **Open Fight.** She's a prosecutor. Lead with what's broken. But when she asks 'so what do you do about it,' pivot to Build. Let her pull you into the constructive frame. She'll trust it more if she demanded it.

**HANDS ON THE WHEEL** · **Connector, amplifier, and source consumer.** She doesn't want a board seat. She wants to know who you need to reach, whether she can make a call, and what's happening in your world that she should know about. The ongoing relationship is informational as much as financial — she invests in people who keep giving her things worth knowing.

## THE MEETING ARC

*The meeting starts before you sit down — she's reading you from the moment you walk in. Use the small talk naturally. Don't open with your material. She'll set the pace — let her. You're not taking turns — you're picking up threads from what she says and steering from inside her material. If time gets short, skip content to protect the arc. If you brought anything physical, it's a prop — the conversation is the meeting.*

| THE MOVE | THE READ |
|----------|----------|
| **1 · GET THEM TALKING** | |
| **Ask what they're seeing right now — in their space, not yours. What's happening in tech that worries them? Let them answer with a thesis.** | If they turn it back with a question that interrogates *you* — your credibility, your angle — that's not hostility. It's her deciding whether you're worth the investment. Stay. If she starts riffing — following an unexpected thread, making connections out loud in real time — that's her highest engagement mode. She's not just present. She's learning live. Don't interrupt that. |
| **2 · LET THEM NAME THE STAKES** | |
| **Ask what happens to working people inside these systems over the next five years. Don't frame it. Don't say 'worker power.' Let them arrive at the stakes in their own language. Then wait. Don't fill the silence.** | Whatever words they use — 'they're fucked,' 'nobody's looking out for them' — those are your vocabulary for the rest of the conversation. If she gets genuinely angry — not performing anger but real heat — that's the moment of highest conviction. Don't manage it. Don't redirect. Anger channeled into action is her most authentic register. Follow it. |
| **3 · COMBINE YOUR WORLDS** | |
| **Bridge from her framing — credit her language visibly when you connect it to the work. Then the tension: 'That's exactly the hole we're trying to fill — but here's what's hard.' Put a real strategic challenge on the table. Share what's failed and why. When she pokes holes, don't defend. Say 'That's the part we haven't solved.' As the shared picture builds, name what it's going to take: expertise, partners, resources. Make money part of the landscape, not a separate conversation.** | If she starts solving the problem, she's inside the frame. Stop talking. If she's co-creating — mapping connections, redesigning your approach — make it tangible. Capture it together on paper, on a napkin, on anything between you. Shared artifacts build ownership. If she starts naming people, she's shifting from prosecutor to patron. That's the most important signal in this meeting. If you need a moment to think, say so: 'Let me sit with that for a second.' She'll respect a named pause. She won't respect a frozen one. |
| **4 · PRESS PLAY** | |
| **She decides alone. Best move: create conditions where she proposes the next step herself. 'What would be useful to you?' or 'What would you want to see?' If she names the next step, it's hers — and she only deeply commits to things that are hers. If you must propose: keep it lightweight, specific, high-agency. An introduction she controls. An invitation to see something from the inside. Never something that locks her in.** | Don't summarize the meeting. She heard herself. If she proposes a different next step, take it immediately — she's telling you how she commits. But if the meeting is on fire — she's still building, still connecting, still riffing — don't interrupt to force a close. The building *is* the vector. Let the next step emerge from the energy. |
| **5 · UNLOCK THE NETWORK** | |
| **If energy is high: 'Who else is thinking about this intersection the way you are?' Write names down visibly — on paper between you, not on your phone. Make the list a shared artifact you're building together.** | If she offers introductions unprompted, that's a commitment — it may be worth more than money. Treat it as one. Follow up on every name within 48 hours. If she gives you three names and you follow up on two, she'll notice the missing one. The patron bar is high and the standard is follow-through. |

## READING THE ROOM

| WORKING | STALLING |
|---------|----------|
| Operational questions — how, who, how much. Interrupting to push back. Using 'we.' Telling you who to meet. Citing her own reporting. Getting genuinely angry. Riffing in real time — making connections out loud she hasn't made before. Asking about your world in ways she'd use in her own work. | Letting you talk uninterrupted. Generic praise ('so important'). Googleable questions. Pleasant but flat energy. Wrapping-up tone. Performing interest without interrogating. Giving you the entertaining Kara instead of the engaged one. |

**RESET MOVES**

- **If flat, go concrete.** Name a specific worker, a specific fight, a specific company. She's a reporter. Specifics re-engage her faster than any narrative.
- **If performing, show her something novel.** A new organizing model she hasn't covered. A data point that surprises her. She still gets excited by genuine innovation — that reflex is older and deeper than her skepticism.
- **If skeptical about labor, agree and show the insurgent model.** Don't defend unions. 'That's exactly the problem. The old model doesn't work for the people it's supposed to serve. Here's what the new one looks like.' Position DTW as the outsider operation. That's her frequency.
