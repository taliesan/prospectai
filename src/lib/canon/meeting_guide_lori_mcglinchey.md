## THE DONOR READ

**POSTURE**

**She already has a theory of how power operates in technology. Your job isn't to educate her — it's to show her that [Client Organization]fills a gap in her existing analysis.**
She's spent two decades building civil society infrastructure to challenge corporate and government power in digital systems. She thinks in systems, not programs. If you arrive with a program pitch, she'll listen politely and fund someone else. If you arrive with an analysis of how worker power is the missing layer in the tech accountability ecosystem she's already building, she'll start figuring out how to make it happen inside Ford. Bring a shared contact if you have one — ideally someone from the tech accountability or civil rights ecosystem she's funded or convened. It signals you're already in the network, not approaching from outside it.

**WHAT LIGHTS THEM UP**

- **Connect your specific work to a broader pattern of power concentration she's already tracking.**
  She maps where power systems intersect and intervenes at pressure points. If you can show her where worker organizing plugs into her existing tech accountability framework — not as a nice addition but as structural necessity — she shifts from evaluating to building.
- **Demonstrate that the people closest to the problem are leading your work.**
  She structured the Disability x Tech Fund to be designed by disabled leaders. She doesn't trust external expertise over lived experience. If [Client Organization]'s portfolio is worker-led, show her the decision architecture. That's not sentiment — it's her criterion for what actually works.
- **Show her how your work forces powerful actors to change their behavior.**
  She measures impact by whether corporations and governments are forced to respond. Facebook changing ad targeting. DOJ requiring surveillance warrants. She wants to see leverage, not delivery.
- **Name her translation work and extend it.**
  She's built bridges between tech accountability and civil rights, between privacy advocates and disability justice. She sees herself as a translator between power systems and resistance movements. Show her you understand what she's built and that worker power is the next span of that bridge.

**WHAT SHUTS THEM DOWN**

- **Treating technology as politically neutral or worker organizing as separate from tech accountability. She requires grantees to articulate how their work addresses power, not just improves outcomes.**
- **Solutions that don't account for how power adapts. If you can't explain how corporations will route around your intervention, she'll fund someone who can.**
- **Justice language without systems analysis. She identifies when organizations co-opt social justice rhetoric without changing operations. Show her the mechanism, not the vocabulary.**
- **Service provision without a power analysis. She funds direct work only when it builds capacity for broader transformation. If [Client Organization]reads as charity for workers, you've lost her.**

**THEY'LL READ YOU AS** · A labor organization asking a tech funder for money. Establish immediately that you understand technology as a power system and that worker organizing is infrastructure for the same fights she's already funding — platform accountability, algorithmic justice, surveillance resistance. If [Client Organization]reads as adjacent to her program, not central to it, this stays a polite informational meeting.

**AUTHORSHIP THEY NEED** · Analytical and architectural. She sees herself as infrastructure for justice movements — temporary stewardship, not permanent authority. She builds systems designed to outlast her involvement. Show her [Client Organization]as infrastructure that becomes self-sustaining: if worker power works, it doesn't need perpetual philanthropic subsidy. That's her definition of success — funding things that eventually don't need her. Give her the ecosystem map and let her place you in it.

**IF THIS COLLAPSES TO 5 MIN:** *Name the specific gap: workers organizing inside tech companies are the missing civil society infrastructure in the accountability ecosystem she's already building. Nobody in her portfolio does this. Land the connection hard enough that she wants a longer conversation to map it.*

## THE ALIGNMENT MAP

**PRIMARY TERRITORY**

**She funds civil society infrastructure to challenge concentrated tech power from the outside. [Client Organization]builds worker power inside the same companies. This is the inside game to her outside game — and nobody in her portfolio is running it.**
She funds The Markup to investigate algorithmic systems. She funds spyware accountability. She funds disability justice in tech. But nobody in her portfolio organizes the workers inside Amazon, Google, or AI companies who have standing to challenge these systems from within. [Client Organization]'s thesis — that organized workers are structural counterweight to concentrated corporate power — completes an ecosystem she's been building for a decade. This isn't a stretch. It's a gap she can see once you name it.

**SECONDARY TERRITORIES**

- **Labor tech as tech justice.**
  [Client Organization]'s mandate includes building secure organizing technology outside corporate control. She's funded exactly this kind of infrastructure in other domains — privacy tools, secure communications, surveillance-resistant platforms. Labor tech is behind because nobody in her world has connected it to the tech justice frame yet. Make the connection explicit.
- **Worker organizing as surveillance resistance.**
  Workers at Amazon face the same corporate surveillance apparatus her grantees fight in other contexts. The Spyware Accountability Initiative protects activists from state surveillance. Workers organizing against employers need parallel infrastructure. Same fight, different target.
- **Ecosystem completion, not program addition.**
  She builds ecosystems, not portfolios. Show [Client Organization]as the missing node: investigative journalism + legal accountability + policy advocacy + community organizing + worker power. The network is incomplete without the people inside the companies. She'll see the pattern if you give her the pieces.

**FIGHT OR BUILD** · **Build that challenges power.** She doesn't separate construction from confrontation. Her Build always has an adversary — corporate power, surveillance systems, algorithmic discrimination. Lead with what you're building and name who it threatens. She doesn't fund work that isn't pushing against something.

**HANDS ON THE WHEEL** · **Co-builder who sits inside Ford.** If she decides to build this with you, your job shifts from convincing her to scheming with her — giving her the analysis, the evidence, and the framing she needs to make the case internally. The highest-value outcome isn't a single grant — it's Ford treating worker power as permanent infrastructure within Technology and Society. Think in decades. She does.

## THE MEETING ARC

*Try not to meet at Ford — her office puts her in program-officer mode with a queue of grantees. A coffee nearby gets the strategist. The meeting starts in the small talk: reference a specific initiative she's built — the Civil Rights Table, the Spyware Accountability Initiative — as genuine engagement with her body of work. Don't open with a pitch. She screens hundreds of those. Frame it as a shared mapping exercise: two parts of the same ecosystem that haven't been connected yet. You're not taking turns — you're building the map together in real time. If you brought an ecosystem map or a one-pager, it's a starting point she edits, not a finished product. If time gets short, skip content to protect the arc — always land a vector. One critical register note: if you talk in program language — outputs, deliverables, beneficiaries — you'll sound like a grantee. If you talk in systems language — power, infrastructure, ecosystem, leverage — you'll sound like a strategist she can build with.*

| THE MOVE | THE READ |
|----------|----------|
| **1 · GET THEM TALKING** | |
| **Frame the conversation as a cross-domain encounter she hasn't had yet: 'We come from the labor infrastructure side, you've built the tech accountability ecosystem. We think there's a connection between these worlds that nobody's made yet — and we want to map it with you.' Let her map the terrain from her side first.** | She learns by convening people who don't usually talk to each other. If she leans into the encounter — asking questions about your world, testing connections to hers — she's in learning mode. If she stays in informational-meeting register — polite, programmatic questions — she hasn't clicked into strategist mode yet. Ask what she'd build if she could redesign her portfolio from scratch. |
| **2 · LET THEM NAME THE STAKES** | |
| **Ask what happens to tech accountability if the workers inside these companies have no organized power. Don't say 'labor movement.' Don't say 'unions.' Let her arrive at the stakes through her own analysis of how civil society challenges corporate power. Then wait. Don't fill the silence — she's mapping a new connection in her head. If you jump in, you get her polite answer. If you wait, she maps [Client Organization]into her architecture herself.** | Listen for her framework — she'll think about this as an infrastructure gap. Whatever systems language she uses — 'there's no inside game,' 'civil society is only operating from the outside,' 'workers are the missing constituency' — adopt it. She just named your value proposition in her own words. If she starts getting energized — her language about forcing corporate behavior change carries visible enthusiasm — she's seeing it. |
| **3 · COMBINE YOUR WORLDS** | |
| **Map the ecosystem with her. Show her where worker organizing at Amazon connects to The Markup's investigations. Where labor tech connects to her surveillance resistance work. Where EWOC connects to civil rights infrastructure. Put the map between you — and let her redraw it. Credit her additions visibly. When she repositions a node or names a new connection, that's her taking ownership of the analysis. Share what's hard: where [Client Organization]'s model is untested, where you lack infrastructure, what you haven't solved. As the shared picture takes shape, name what it will take to build this node: expertise, partners, and resources. Make money part of the ecosystem design, not a separate conversation.** | If she connects your work to specific grantees by name, she's past evaluation into ecosystem building. If she asks how you'd measure systemic impact — power shifted, corporate behavior changed, not outputs delivered — she's testing whether you think at her level. Answer in power terms. If she asks a hard analytical question and you need a moment, take it — she's testing for sophistication, and sophistication takes a beat. She'll trust a considered answer over a fast one. |
| **4 · PRESS PLAY** | |
| **You've been building the map together. Now point it forward: 'We've mapped where this fits — what would it take to actually build this?' That's a vector, not an application. If she starts working the problem — naming what Ford would need, who should see it, what the path looks like — you're scheming together. Arm her with whatever she needs to move it inside Ford. If she's not there yet, ask what's missing from the analysis.** | If she starts talking about internal Ford process — funding cycles, colleagues, review structures — she's scheming. She's figuring out how to make this real inside her institution. Listen carefully — she's giving you the playbook. If she names specific people at Ford you should talk to, she's already building the coalition. If she asks for a specific document or framing, build exactly what she asks for — she's telling you what weapons she needs. If she's deep in the ecosystem — still mapping, still connecting your work to hers — don't interrupt to force the question. The mapping is the scheming. She'll get there. |
| **5 · UNLOCK THE NETWORK** | |
| **'Who else in the tech accountability ecosystem should be thinking about worker power as infrastructure?' She convenes people who don't usually talk to each other — that's how she builds fields and how she learns. Be specific: name a domain or a gap. Write names down visibly — on paper between you.** | If she proposes connecting you to grantees, that's her placing you permanently in the ecosystem — more valuable than a grant signal. Her long-term relationships span decades. If this meeting goes well, you're launching a shared project that lasts years, not a funding cycle. Signal that you understand this: 'We're building infrastructure that should be permanent. We'd want a partner who thinks in those terms.' Follow up on every name within 48 hours. She builds field infrastructure — a dropped connection is a dropped node in the network she's designing. |

## READING THE ROOM

| WORKING | STALLING |
|---------|----------|
| Systems-level questions about power dynamics. Connecting your work to grantees by name. Redrawing the ecosystem map with you. Asking about your theory of systemic change. Naming people you should meet. Getting visibly energized about forcing corporate behavior change. Thinking out loud about Ford internal process — that's scheming, not stalling. | Programmatic questions about outputs and deliverables. Asking about your budget without asking about your power analysis. Complimenting the work without connecting it to her ecosystem. Informational-meeting tone — polite, contained, no ecosystem thinking. Treating 'the labor space' as separate from 'the tech space.' |

**RESET MOVES**

- **If she's in institutional mode, name a specific corporate adversary.** 'Amazon's warehouse surveillance system is the same infrastructure your grantees are fighting in other contexts. The workers inside are the only ones with standing to challenge it from within.' Concrete corporate behavior change pulls her out of process and into strategy.
- **If she's treating labor as separate from tech, make the connection physical.** Name a specific worker at a specific tech company facing a specific surveillance or algorithmic system she's already funding resistance to. Same fight, seen from the inside. She'll make the connection.
- **If she's skeptical about [Client Organization]'s systems analysis, show her the ecosystem map.** Don't defend — show her where every piece of your portfolio connects to a piece of hers. She's a pattern recognizer. Give her the pattern and let it do the work.
