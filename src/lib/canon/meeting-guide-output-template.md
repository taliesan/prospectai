### THE ARC

**Beat 1: Get Them Talking**

*Get them present as a person, not a title. Until they're speaking from curiosity instead of expertise, nothing else in this conversation will land.*

**START.** [1–3 sentences. How to open this beat with this person.]

**STAY.** [What to watch for, what to do about it. Includes a stalling indicator and recovery. Prose or bullets — match the exemplars.]

**CONTINUE.** [1–3 sentences. Observable state that means this beat is done. Signal: presence — they're thinking in real time and there's feeling behind it.]

---

**Beat 2: Let Them Name the Stakes**

*Get them to say, in their own words, what they think is broken or at risk. Their language becomes the frame you build on for the rest of the meeting.*

**START.** [1–3 sentences.]

**STAY.** [What to watch for, what to do about it. Includes a stalling indicator and recovery.]

**CONTINUE.** [1–3 sentences. Signal: language — they've named something specific with energy behind it.]

---

**Beat 3: Combine Your Worlds**

*Connect their language to the work. Sketch it together so it becomes theirs. This is where "your project" becomes "our problem."*

**START.** [1–3 sentences.]

**STAY.** [What to watch for, what to do about it. Includes a stalling indicator and recovery.]

**CONTINUE.** [1–3 sentences. Signal: co-ownership — "you" has become "we," or they're shaping the work.]

---

**Beat 4: Press Play**

*Start the work before the meeting ends. Find something for each of you to do and a reason to come back together.*

**START.** [1–3 sentences.]

**STAY.** [What to watch for, what to do about it. Includes a stalling indicator and recovery.]

**CONTINUE.** [1–3 sentences. Signal: momentum — the conversation has grown beyond one meeting.]

---

**Beat 5: Unlock the Network**

*Find out who else should be in this conversation. This is where their social capital converts into reach for the work. Protect time for it — it's often where the best leads come from.*

**START.** [1–3 sentences.]

**STAY.** [What to watch for, what to do about it. Includes a stalling indicator and recovery.]

**CONTINUE.** [1–3 sentences. Signal: warmth and specificity — next steps confirmed, follow-up anchored, relationship established.]

---

### TRIPWIRES

**[Tripwire label 1.]** *Tell:* [Observable signal — 1 sentence.] *Recovery:* [What to do — 1 sentence.]

- At least one tripwire is about the **fundraiser's** likely mistake, not the donor's behavior.
- CONTINUE signals are **observable states**, not internal feelings.
- STAY sections include at least one **stalling indicator** with a recovery move.
- Where to Focus references the **organization's actual strategic components** by name.
- Logistics rationales are **tied to this donor's profile**, not generic meeting advice.
