## MEETING GUIDE — CRAIG NEWMARK

---

### SETUP

**Who They Are.**
- Built one thing, stayed with it for thirty years, and descended rather than climbed — staff told him he was a bad manager, he accepted the verdict, and went to customer service representative, where he stayed for two decades.
- "Old-school nerd" is not a persona. Socially isolated through adolescence and into his 40s, he can "simulate social skills, maybe as long as ninety minutes at a time." Self-deprecating humor is his primary social tool — it's not warming up, it IS the conversation.
- Trusts people by default and the betrayal response is permanent. He takes people at their word — said so under oath. But he never spoke to Meg Whitman again after eBay betrayed him. Don't break a commitment. The recovery cost isn't proportional — it's total.

**How to Engage.**
- Match his compression. Short sentences, immediate specifics, no preamble. He communicates in bursts — "Hey," then straight to the point. If you're talking more than he is, you're pitching, and pitching is the wrong mode.
- Lead with what you've done, not what you plan to do. A number, a result, a specific problem you're solving. He knows he's shallow on everything he funds and he's honest about it — he's looking for people who are deep where he's shallow.
- Keep the register human. He uses humor to navigate every social interaction — self-deprecating, nerd-friendly, tolerant of pigeon references. If you're formal and strategic, his social battery drains faster and you won't know it's happening.

**Where to Focus.**
- Lead with **Organize** framed as democratic infrastructure. He believes American democratic systems are under attack from multiple directions and the institutions that should be organizing the defense can't keep up. Workers are part of that defense system — when the people keeping the country running have no way to organize, the whole infrastructure is more fragile.
- Ground it in **Fight** through the patriotic lens — protecting the country, protecting regular people, civil defense for the digital age. Frame organizing as building a durable system, not as advocacy or confrontation.
- **Innovate** is the hardest sell but the most natural fit for his model — new organizational forms that don't require his ongoing participation. His best relationships are with organizations that take his resources and go.
- Connect to populations he's already committed to. Many workers in organizing campaigns are veterans, military families, or essential workers — the same people he already supports through Bob Woodruff Foundation. Same people, different entry point.
- He follows evidence over sentiment and he'll redirect resources when the evidence says to. Bring data. If your work produces measurable results, lead with them. If it doesn't yet, lead with the measurement plan.

**Logistics.**
- **Venue:** Coffee, not dinner. Not a gala. Keep the setting simple so neither of you has to perform. Morning, not end of day.
- **Duration:** Short. Forty-five minutes is ideal. Sixty is fine. Don't schedule ninety and hope for the best — his social simulation degrades and he won't tell you it's happening.
- **Who to bring:** Keep it small and operational. Don't bring someone whose job is to build rapport — bring someone who can answer his number questions. If he asks how much a campaign costs, someone in the room should know to the dollar.

### THE ARC

**Beat 1: Get Them Talking**

*Get them present as a person, not a title. Until they're speaking from curiosity instead of expertise, nothing else in this conversation will land.*

**START.** Start with the problem, not the person. Connect to something he already funds, or lead with a specific result from the field.

**STAY.** With him, presence looks different. He's not going to get animated or lean in — he's going to ask a question. The engagement signal is operational specificity: he asks about cost, scale, geography, conversion rate. If he names someone in his network — "Bob Woodruff Foundation does something similar" — that's not a brush-off, that's how he works. Silence means he's thinking, not disengaging. Wait.

If he's pleasant but generic — "that sounds interesting" without a follow-up question — your work hasn't connected to something he cares about yet. Make the connection explicit: democratic infrastructure, the same framework as his journalism and cybersecurity work, applied to workers. Watch for the hedging tell too — if he shifts from casual self-deprecation to careful, qualified statements, something has gone wrong. Don't push.

**CONTINUE.** When he's asking operational questions or naming people in his network. That's his version of presence — engaged, specific, connecting you to his world.

---

**Beat 2: Let Them Name the Stakes**

*Get them to say, in their own words, what they think is broken or at risk. Their language becomes the frame you build on for the rest of the meeting.*

**START.** What happens to the people doing essential work — not journalists, not cyber professionals, but the workers keeping systems running — if they have no organized support when the next disruption hits?

**STAY.** Let him connect workers to the things he already cares about. Don't make the connection for him — if he gets there himself, you're most of the way to a commitment. He understands the world through historical comparisons and simple frames: "the immune system of democracy," "duck and cover for the digital age." If he puts worker organizing inside one of those frames, it lands deeper than any argument you could build. The topics he's most likely to light up on are:

- **Workers as democratic infrastructure** — the people keeping systems running have no organized defense. He sees cybersecurity, journalism, and veteran support as parts of the same defense system. If he puts workers in that system, you're aligned.
- **Specific populations he already protects** — veterans, military families, essential workers. If he starts mapping your work onto people he's already committed to, follow his mapping. Use his populations, not yours.
- **The gap nobody's filling** — "nobody's building this." He responds to structural absences the way he responded to the absence of public interest technology in journalism. If he names the gap, he's already evaluating whether to fill it.

If he treats it as adjacent but outside his area, bridge through a population he already protects. If he asks about the political dimension — unions, labor movement — stay in building language: infrastructure that lets workers organize, not campaigns that fight companies.

**CONTINUE.** When he connects the work to something he already funds or names a gap with specificity behind it.

---

**Beat 3: Combine Your Worlds**

*Connect their language to the work. Sketch it together so it becomes theirs. This is where "your project" becomes "our problem."*

**START.** Show him the machine. What it costs to run a campaign. Your win rate. Where you've failed and what you learned. Frame the scope with numbers.

**STAY.** He doesn't want to help you design it — he wants to see that it works and then fund it. Give him the data to make that evaluation. Listen for where he's going:

- **He's asking detailed operational questions** — costs, geography, staffing, failure rates. He's evaluating whether you're someone he can trust with resources. Give him everything. Don't summarize, don't round.
- **He's comparing you to something he already funds** — he's mapping your operation onto his existing portfolio. Show him what's similar and what's different. If he compares you to a failed bet, show him the track record that separates you.
- **He asks "how much do you need"** — he's past evaluation. Give him the number. Be specific. Don't hedge.

When it's stalling: he's polite but hasn't asked a single number question after five minutes. Offer the data directly — your campaign economics, everything on the table.

**CONTINUE.** When he's asking number questions or comparing you to an operation he already funds. He doesn't co-create — he evaluates and decides.

---

**Beat 4: Press Play**

*Start the work before the meeting ends. Find something for each of you to do and a reason to come back together.*

**START.** Frame the ask at full scale — here's what the work needs and what it funds. He doesn't do pilots or phased approaches. When he decides, the commitment is large and immediate.

**STAY.** Listen for which mode he's in:

- **He asks where to send resources or names a specific amount** — decision is made. Give him the logistics. Keep it operational.
- **He routes you to a specific person and explains why** — that's a commitment. The intermediary is the path forward. Follow up within 48 hours using exactly his framing.
- **He's still asking operational questions** — he's not done evaluating. Don't rush the ask. Let him finish.

If he routes you to someone without context — just "talk to X" — that might be redirecting you away rather than toward. Ask what he wants them to look at. If he says "send me something" without specifics, convert it: one page, your campaign economics, where the money goes, tomorrow.

**CONTINUE.** When there's a clear next step — resources flowing, an intermediary engaged, or a specific document he's asked for.

---

**Beat 5: Unlock the Network**

*Find out who else should be in this conversation. This is where their social capital converts into reach for the work. Protect time for it — it's often where the best leads come from.*

**START.** He connects people who work on similar problems, not people who believe in similar things. Ask about adjacent operators: who in his veteran support network is seeing worker exploitation as a force protection issue. Anyone in his cybersecurity work dealing with the labor side of critical infrastructure.

**STAY.** His network is operators and intermediary organizations — Bob Woodruff Foundation, Blue Star Families, Aspen Digital, ProPublica. He routes through them.

- **He names someone with context** — "talk to X, they're seeing the same thing in Y." That's social capital. Follow up within 48 hours with exactly the framing he gave you.
- **He offers to make an introduction directly** — strongest signal in the meeting. He's invested.
- **He names someone from a completely different domain** — cybersecurity, journalism, policy. He's seeing a connection you haven't made yet. Ask him what he sees.

If he doesn't engage with the network question, don't push. He may not be ready to put his name behind you yet. Close clean and follow up in writing.

**CONTINUE.** End clean. Thank him briefly — especially around whatever connected in Beat 2. Confirm next steps. Don't linger. Follow up fast with exactly what you said you'd send.

### TRIPWIRES

**Talking too much.** *Tell:* short responses, minimal engagement, silence that feels different from his thinking silence. *Recovery:* stop. Ask one operational question. Let him lead.

**Triggering the tech-blame frame.** *Tell:* he shifts to careful, qualified language — hedging, indirect answers, or mentioning craigslist unprompted. *Recovery:* pivot to building language. Don't address what triggered it.

**Looking like a promising experiment instead of a proven operation.** *Tell:* he starts routing you to intermediaries when he wasn't before. *Recovery:* return to track record — campaigns run, results delivered, what failed and what you changed.

---

### ONE LINE

He funds people getting stuff done and gets out of the way — show him the machine, not the vision.
