## MEETING GUIDE — ROY BAHAT

---

### SETUP

**Who They Are.**
- A venture capitalist who chairs the country's most prominent business-labor dialogue and advised the first Starbucks union organizers. He doesn't resolve the contradiction — it's what gives him access to both sides.
- Radical transparency as operating principle. He published his own flaws as a leader, open-sourced his fund's manual, and lists his unemployment periods on his resume. He puts everything on the table before anyone can use it against him.
- Chronic interrupter — he says so himself. The interruptions are the engagement signal. When they stop and he goes smooth and polite, you've lost him.

**How to Engage.**
- Show up like a founder, not a grantee. Name a failure before a win. Share your numbers before he asks. If you sound like you're making a case, he'll be polite and you'll never hear from him again.
- Set context before diving in — frame what you want to cover and where you want his input. Without that, his rapid-fire questioning becomes an interrogation instead of a collaboration.
- Push back when he challenges you. He changes his mind mid-conversation and needs you to hold your ground. If you capitulate, he'll worry you don't have conviction.

**Where to Focus.**
- Lead with **Innovate** — the capital structure that doesn't exist yet. Nobody deploys capital for worker organizing the way venture deploys capital for startups: absorbing early risk, proving models, then leveraging larger pools. That's his language and his logic.
- Ground it in **Organize** — real workers, real campaigns, specific numbers. What a drive costs, your conversion rate, where you've lost. Match his information density or he'll read you as performing expertise rather than living it.
- **Fight** is the closing window. A specific deadline, not a vague urgency — AI is reorganizing warehouse labor faster than anyone is organizing warehouse workers, and the window is measured in months.
- His argument only works if it's both a market failure and a justice problem. He arrived at pro-labor through economics, not politics. Lead with market logic, but don't strip the moral weight — he needs both registers to stay engaged.
- Underneath the systems thinking, what moves him is human capacity — agency, belonging, people being needed. One practitioner story from the field reaches that layer. But only after the systems conversation has earned enough trust.

**Logistics.**
- **Venue:** Not Bloomberg Beta — his office puts him in fund-manager mode. A coffee shop or a walk gets the intellectual explorer. Somewhere noisy enough that you're both leaning in.
- **Duration:** Morning or lunch, open-ended. Not a scheduled 30-minute slot at the end of his day. He'll go long if he's building something.
- **Who to bring:** Keep it 1:1 unless you bring someone from the field — an organizer, a worker who's been through a campaign. He defers to practitioner experience. A second executive adds nothing.

### THE ARC

**Beat 1: Get Them Talking**

*Get them present as a person, not a title. Until they're speaking from curiosity instead of expertise, nothing else in this conversation will land.*

**START.** Ask about the person, not the fund. What got him into the future-of-work space. What he's teaching this semester. What's changed his mind recently.

**STAY.** He'll probably start with a polished future-of-work take — he's given it a hundred times. Fine, but it's not presence yet. The shift you're waiting for is when he stops giving rehearsed answers and starts chasing something he's actually turning over. If he stays on autopilot, ask what he's seeing that consensus hasn't caught up to. Ask what problem he's chewing on — not what he's working on, what he's stuck on.

**CONTINUE.** When he's thinking in real time rather than broadcasting — and when there's energy behind it. He's gotten sharp, frustrated, excited, curious. The interruptions have started. You need both: intellectual presence and emotional presence.

---

**Beat 2: Let Them Name the Stakes**

*Get them to say, in their own words, what they think is broken or at risk. Their language becomes the frame you build on for the rest of the meeting.*

**START.** What happens to workers in your portfolio companies' industries if organizing infrastructure doesn't exist in five years?

**STAY.** Don't say "movement." Don't say "justice." Let him arrive at the stakes in his own language. If you rush to reframe, you'll get the analytical answer. If you wait, you might get the real one. Listen for when he's in it — the interruptions pick up, he's leaning forward, he's not giving the Aspen version anymore. The topics he's most likely to light up on are:

- **The capital gap** — nobody absorbing early risk for organizing the way venture absorbs risk for startups. If he names this unprompted, he just did your work for you.
- **AI displacement** — his future-of-work thesis made urgent and concrete. Workers reorganized before they can organize.
- **Institutional failure of existing labor** — old models don't iterate, unions can't reach new-economy workers, the infrastructure wasn't built for this.
- **Human cost** — he shifts from systems language to human language: agency, belonging, people being needed. That's what he actually cares about underneath the economics. Follow it.

If he stays analytical and distant, deploy a specific number from the field. Something he hasn't heard. Watch whether it activates him.

**CONTINUE.** When he names a gap or structural failure with energy behind it. Whatever language he uses, adopt it for the rest of the meeting.

---

**Beat 3: Combine Your Worlds**

*Connect their language to the work. Sketch it together so it becomes theirs. This is where "your project" becomes "our problem."*

**START.** Bridge from his words. Share real constraints — your budget, your portfolio, what's working, what's failing, where you're stuck. Present it as emerging, not finished.

**STAY.** Listen for which part of the work he grabs — that tells you where to go deeper:

- **He grabs the capital structure** — how philanthropic seed capital proves models that unlock union treasuries and foundation portfolios. That's Innovate. He'll recognize his own deployment logic. Let him run with it.
- **He starts redesigning the model out loud** — stop talking. Let him build. Get something on paper between you. Credit what he adds. This is the meeting working.
- **He's skeptical about legacy labor** — agree with him. The old model doesn't iterate. Show him what's replacing it: worker-led campaigns, new organizational forms, models that bypass traditional infrastructure.

When it's stalling: he's evaluating, not building. Asking "how does this work?" rather than shaping it. Hand him a real constraint with real parameters and ask him to allocate. He can't resist an unsolved problem with boundaries.

**CONTINUE.** When "you" becomes "we." Or when he's asking shaping questions — costs, conversion rates, what scales and what doesn't.

---

**Beat 4: Press Play**

*Start the work before the meeting ends. Find something for each of you to do and a reason to come back together.*

**START.** Side-project scale — he escalates on his own terms. Offer something specific: your diligence on one campaign for thirty minutes of his reaction, a seat in a room where organizers and funders are working through a real problem, a pressure-test on your next allocation decision.

**STAY.** He'll probably propose his own version of the next step — take it. He's telling you how he wants to engage. If he says "let me think about it," he means it — don't push. If he retreats to advisor mode — encouraging but vague, "send me something" — convert it by asking what specifically he'd want to see. The point is he's doing something, not just endorsing something. If energy is fading, go minimum viable: one page, your three bets and why, poke holes.

**CONTINUE.** When the conversation has grown into something bigger than one meeting. He knows what he's doing next — reviewing a specific piece of your work, connecting you to someone from his Aspen roundtable, pressure-testing a decision you're facing. The thing you started together now has its own momentum.

---

**Beat 5: Unlock the Network**

*Find out who else should be in this conversation. This is where their social capital converts into reach for the work. Protect time for it — it's often where the best leads come from.*

**START.** Frame it as cross-domain, not just labor. Who in AI ethics or platform governance is thinking about the labor side of this. Anyone in his roundtable or portfolio who'd want to argue about whether this model works.

**STAY.** He sits at the intersection of venture, labor, tech, and policy — his network crosses worlds that don't normally talk to each other. Write names down visibly — make the list a shared artifact.

- **He names someone with context** — he's investing social capital. Follow up within 48 hours on every name.
- **He offers to make the introduction himself** — that's the strongest signal in this meeting.
- **He names someone unexpected** — outside labor, outside philanthropy. Pay close attention. That's his cross-domain vision, and he just shared a piece of it.

If he hesitates, he's scanning for risk. Don't push. Leave the door open.

**CONTINUE.** End warm. Thank him — especially around whatever he named in Beat 2 that had heat behind it. Confirm next steps. Follow up fast.

### TRIPWIRES

**Sounding like a grantee instead of a founder.** *Tell:* he's pleasant and encouraging but the energy is flat — you're getting a meeting that will never turn into anything. *Recovery:* name a specific number, a failure, or an unsolved problem. Get back to building.

**Leading with justice language without market logic underneath.** *Tell:* he's nodding but not engaging — polite agreement without interruptions. *Recovery:* reframe through economics. Worker power as demand signal, not moral claim.

**Letting him advise instead of build.** *Tell:* he's giving you suggestions from the outside rather than shaping the work from inside. *Recovery:* hand him a real constraint with real parameters. Put him back to work.

---

### ONE LINE

He arrived at labor through capital, not politics — show him the market failure and let him find the moral imperative on his own.
