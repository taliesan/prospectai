  <h1>Craig Newmark</h1>
</div>

<!-- SETUP -->
<div class="setup">
  <div class="section-label">Setup</div>

  <div class="setup-group">
    <div class="setup-heading">Who They Are</div>
    <ul class="setup-bullets">
      <li>Built one thing, stayed with it for thirty years, and descended rather than climbed — staff told him he was a bad manager, he accepted the verdict, and went to customer service representative, where he stayed for two decades.</li>
      <li>"Old-school nerd" is not a persona. Socially isolated through adolescence and into his 40s, he can "simulate social skills, maybe as long as ninety minutes at a time." Self-deprecating humor is his primary social tool — it's not warming up, it IS the conversation.</li>
      <li>Trusts people by default and the betrayal response is permanent. He takes people at their word — said so under oath. But he never spoke to Meg Whitman again after eBay betrayed him. Don't break a commitment. The recovery cost isn't proportional — it's total.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="setup-group">
    <div class="setup-heading">How to Engage</div>
    <ul class="setup-bullets">
      <li>Match his compression. Short sentences, immediate specifics, no preamble. He communicates in bursts — "Hey," then straight to the point. If you're talking more than he is, you're pitching, and pitching is the wrong mode.</li>
      <li>Lead with what you've done, not what you plan to do. A number, a result, a specific problem you're solving. He knows he's shallow on everything he funds and he's honest about it — he's looking for people who are deep where he's shallow.</li>
      <li>Keep the register human. He uses humor to navigate every social interaction — self-deprecating, nerd-friendly, tolerant of pigeon references. If you're formal and strategic, his social battery drains faster and you won't know it's happening.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="setup-group">
    <div class="setup-heading">Where to Focus</div>
    <ul class="setup-bullets">
      <li>Lead with <strong>Organize</strong> framed as democratic infrastructure. He believes American democratic systems are under attack from multiple directions and the institutions that should be organizing the defense can't keep up. Workers are part of that defense system — when the people keeping the country running have no way to organize, the whole infrastructure is more fragile.</li>
      <li>Ground it in <strong>Fight</strong> through the patriotic lens — protecting the country, protecting regular people, civil defense for the digital age. Frame organizing as building a durable system, not as advocacy or confrontation.</li>
      <li><strong>Innovate</strong> is the hardest sell but the most natural fit for his model — new organizational forms that don't require his ongoing participation. His best relationships are with organizations that take his resources and go.</li>
      <li>Connect to populations he's already committed to. Many workers in organizing campaigns are veterans, military families, or essential workers — the same people he already supports through Bob Woodruff Foundation. Same people, different entry point.</li>
      <li>He follows evidence over sentiment and he'll redirect resources when the evidence says to. Bring data. If your work produces measurable results, lead with them. If it doesn't yet, lead with the measurement plan.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="setup-group">
    <div class="setup-heading">Logistics</div>
    <ul class="setup-bullets">
      <li><strong>Venue:</strong> Coffee, not dinner. Not a gala. Keep the setting simple so neither of you has to perform. Morning, not end of day.</li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Short. Forty-five minutes is ideal. Sixty is fine. Don't schedule ninety and hope for the best — his social simulation degrades and he won't tell you it's happening.</li>
      <li><strong>Who to bring:</strong> Keep it small and operational. Don't bring someone whose job is to build rapport — bring someone who can answer his number questions. If he asks how much a campaign costs, someone in the room should know to the dollar.</li>
    </ul>

          <p>With him, presence looks different. He's not going to get animated or lean in — he's going to ask a question. The engagement signal is operational specificity: he asks about cost, scale, geography, conversion rate. If he names someone in his network — "Bob Woodruff Foundation does something similar" — that's not a brush-off, that's how he works. Silence means he's thinking, not disengaging. Wait.</p>

Make the connection explicit: democratic infrastructure, the same framework as his journalism and cybersecurity work, applied to workers. Watch for the hedging tell too — if he shifts from casual self-deprecation to careful, qualified statements, something has gone wrong. Don't push.

          <p>Let him connect workers to the things he already cares about. Don't make the connection for him — if he gets there himself, you're most of the way to a commitment. He understands the world through historical comparisons and simple frames: "the immune system of democracy," "duck and cover for the digital age." If he puts worker organizing inside one of those frames, it lands deeper than any argument you could build. The topics he's most likely to light up on are:</p>
          <ul class="stay-scenarios">
            <li><strong>Workers as democratic infrastructure</strong> — the people keeping systems running have no organized defense. He sees cybersecurity, journalism, and veteran support as parts of the same defense system. If he puts workers in that system, you're aligned.</li>
            <li><strong>Specific populations he already protects</strong> — veterans, military families, essential workers. If he starts mapping your work onto people he's already committed to, follow his mapping. Use his populations, not yours.</li>
            <li><strong>The gap nobody's filling</strong> — "nobody's building this." He responds to structural absences the way he responded to the absence of public interest technology in journalism. If he names the gap, he's already evaluating whether to fill it.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="stalling">
            <span class="stalling-label">Stalling:</span> He treats it as adjacent but outside his area. Bridge through a population he already protects.
