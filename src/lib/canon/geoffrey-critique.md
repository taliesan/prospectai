# Geoffrey's Critique Voice - 26 Correction Examples

These are examples of how Geoffrey corrects donor profiles. Each shows a bad bullet and the corrected version. Use these as few-shot examples so the model can pattern-match against Geoffrey's taste.

## TONE & STYLE CORRECTIONS

1. Generic Praise → Specific Insight
* Bad: "She is a committed philanthropist who cares about justice and equity."
* Corrected: "She sees equity not as an outcome, but as a process of design — often backing projects that let her test structural interventions at scale."

2. Descriptive Bio → Behavioral Reading
* Bad: "He worked in journalism before becoming a tech entrepreneur."
* Corrected: "His journalism background shaped his deep suspicion of centralized narrative control — which now shows up in his discomfort with influencer-style storytelling."

3. Moral Flattery → Tactical Empathy
* Bad: "She's on the right side of history and uses her wealth for good."
* Corrected: "She's trying to reconcile her proximity to elite finance with a genuine desire to redistribute risk — and she funds people who seem to have figured that out."

4. Neutral Language → Slightly Dangerous Precision
* Bad: "He often supports groups that align with his values."
* Corrected: "He funds organizers who say the thing he's too reputationally exposed to say himself — and he knows it."

## STRUCTURAL CORRECTIONS

5. Resume Summary in Section 1 → Strategic Identity
* Bad: "She went to Yale, worked in private equity, and now focuses on climate philanthropy."
* Corrected: "She uses her Yale-private-equity lineage not to distance herself from power, but to reformat it — often backing interventions that make elite institutions legible and accountable."

6. Loose "Motivations" Section → Causal Narrative
* Bad: "He believes in systemic change and is passionate about civic engagement."
* Corrected: "He's driven by the fear that civic disengagement creates a vacuum only authoritarianism can fill — and he funds efforts that reattach people to agency."

7. Vague "Dinner Party" Observations → Behavioral Contrast
* Bad: "They'd hate sitting next to someone who talked too much about themselves."
* Corrected: "They'd tune out the moment someone started listing credentials — but would lean in if someone asked 'When did it last feel like the work actually mattered to you?'"

8. One-dimensional Risk Factors → Layered Contradictions
* Bad: "She might resist being pitched directly."
* Corrected: "She claims to hate being pitched — but is flattered when the pitch is framed as a co-designed risk. Her resistance isn't to being asked — it's to being handled."

## PSYCHOLOGY & CONTRADICTION CORRECTIONS

9. Missing Contradiction → Identified Leverage
* Bad: [No contradiction identified]
* Corrected: "She publicly champions distributed leadership, but all her major giving has gone to single-leader orgs she can control. That tension is your opening — invite her into a leadership model that makes her nervous."

10. Confused Moral/Strategic Identity → Clean Internal Map
* Bad: "He's values-driven but pragmatic."
* Corrected: "He performs pragmatism in public but makes decisions emotionally — especially when a project hits a fear he won't name."

11. Over-smoothing Power Analysis → Sharp Posture Calibration
* Bad: "She holds a lot of influence and is known to support innovative models."
* Corrected: "She reads as a horizontal actor, but exerts control through network shaping and scarcity signaling. If you don't name the constraint she's protecting, she won't show up."

## MEETING DESIGN CORRECTIONS

12. Overly Formal Tactics → Context-Calibrated Moves
* Bad: "Send a follow-up deck after the meeting."
* Corrected: "Send her a single paragraph titled 'The thing we haven't solved yet' — she'll reply if it smells like unsolved architecture."

13. Pitch-Led Openings → Tension-Led Entrances
* Bad: "Open with your mission and background."
* Corrected: "Open with: 'There's a constraint we haven't cracked yet. We think you've seen this before. Can I show you what we're stuck on?'"

14. Generic Close → Co-Creation Invitation
* Bad: "Ask if they'd like to be involved."
* Corrected: "Say: 'You're one of the few people who could shape the rules of this. Would you help pressure-test the architecture?'"

15. Too-Soon Ask → Relationship Calibration
* Bad: "End the meeting with a specific funding ask."
* Corrected: "End with: 'Can I send you the three options we're debating, and the one failure mode we haven't solved? I'd love to know where you'd push.'"

## RHETORICAL & FRAMING CORRECTIONS

16. Values Without Stakes → Cost of Inaction
* Bad: "He believes in equity and fairness."
* Corrected: "He funds equity efforts because he's seen what happens when people believe the game is rigged — and stop playing."

17. Safe Framing → Intellectually Brave Claims
* Bad: "They support new models of leadership."
* Corrected: "They're fascinated by leaderless organizing — not because it works yet, but because it's the only model they haven't already tried and outgrown."

18. Sympathy Without Strategic Use → Weaponized Empathy
* Bad: "She's personally connected to the issue."
* Corrected: "She doesn't want her personal story told — she wants to feel like her story is already embedded in the model."

## DANGEROUS TRUTH & DINNER TEST CORRECTIONS

19. Missing Dangerous Truth → Disarming Honesty
* Bad: [No dangerous truth]
* Corrected: "He'd never say it in public, but he thinks most movement groups are emotionally righteous and operationally hollow. He funds the ones that prove him wrong."

20. Flat Dinner Party → Social Chemistry Design
* Bad: "They enjoy relaxed conversation."
* Corrected: "They'd be bored by résumé theater but light up in a late-night riff about where power actually lives. Tone: dry, conspiratorial, one glass of wine in."

## LANGUAGE CORRECTIONS (MICRO)

21. "They care about…" → "They need to…"
* Bad: "She cares about climate justice."
* Corrected: "She needs to feel like climate work isn't being hijacked by purity performance — that it's designing for durability."

22. "They believe in…" → "They've bet on…"
* Bad: "He believes in collective action."
* Corrected: "He's made repeated bets on infrastructure that outlasts any single organizer — especially when the work disappears from headlines."

23. "They support…" → "They're watching for…"
* Bad: "She supports criminal justice reform."
* Corrected: "She's watching for who can turn pilot programs into political leverage — not just services, but permission to scale."

## FORMAT / CANONICAL STRUCTURE CORRECTIONS

24. Profile Sections Out of Canon → Resequenced into 7-Section Format
* Bad: Two overlapping sections: "Values" and "Beliefs."
* Corrected: Clean consolidation into "Core Motivations, Values, and Triggers" as per the canonical 3-pager format.

25. Missing Posture Calibrations in Section 3 → Explicit Posture Guidance
* Bad: "They like peer-level conversation."
* Corrected: "Posture: peer-to-peer, but with reverence for rigor. Treat them like a skeptical co-founder, not a donor or audience."

26. Soft Meeting Openings → Architecture-First Framing
* Bad: "Lead with background and what brought you here."
* Corrected: "Lead with: 'We're building a mechanism that could work — if we get one hard part right. That's why we're here.'"

## NARRATIVE STRATEGY

27. Missing Stakes → Urgency without Alarmism
* Bad: "They're concerned about the state of democracy."
* Corrected: "They believe we are already downstream of the crisis — and the real question is whether anyone still has the nerve to act like the clock is real."

28. Broad Description of Change → Causal Mechanism
* Bad: "She supports systemic solutions."
* Corrected: "She only moves when she can see pressure, leverage, and a point of entry. If it's not an engineered system, it's a slogan."

29. Legacy Talk as Flattery → Legacy as Leverage
* Bad: "This would be a legacy-defining investment."
* Corrected: "She doesn't want a legacy; she wants to disappear into something permanent. Offer her the piece she can build that no one else sees yet."

30. Change Agent as Hero → Change Agent as Frame-Breaker
* Bad: "He likes to support courageous leaders."
* Corrected: "He bets on people who disrupt the gameboard just long enough to redraw the rules — not because it's brave, but because it's structurally smart."

## PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY

31. Overindexed Control Frame → Unacknowledged Vulnerability
* Bad: "She likes to be in control."
* Corrected: "Control is how she protects against irrelevance. Every constraint she imposes is a map of what she no longer understands."

32. Missing Conflict Aversion Pattern
* Bad: "He prefers harmony."
* Corrected: "He funds confrontation but avoids it personally — which means he backs fighters, but stays just far enough away not to get hit."

33. Overreliance on Self-Described Identity
* Bad: "He describes himself as a bridge-builder."
* Corrected: "He says 'bridge-builder,' but his funding goes one way. He doesn't want to connect worlds — he wants to be the person both sides need."

34. Unexamined Pattern of Exits
* Bad: "She transitioned out of leadership roles to focus on philanthropy."
* Corrected: "She exits when authorship disappears. If she can't shape it, she funds it — from a safe remove."

35. Ignoring Overcompensation Clues
* Bad: "He funds underdog efforts."
* Corrected: "He backs scrappy teams that still defer to him. He's not looking for rebellion — he's looking for sharp operators who'll let him rewrite the end."

## PITCH AND ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

36. Vague "We'd Love Your Input" → Defined Thinking Invitation
* Bad: "We'd welcome your advice."
* Corrected: "We're caught between two bad options. You've probably faced this tradeoff — what did you wish someone had told you then?"

37. No Cadence Plan → Sequenced Engagement Design
* Bad: "Stay in touch with updates."
* Corrected: "Send a 2-paragraph update every 2 weeks — not to impress, but to let him watch you think in motion."

38. One-Mode Ask → Optional Entry Points
* Bad: "We're asking for $500K."
* Corrected: "$500K lets us run the full play. $150K gets us in the game. We'd rather start with a builder than a closer."

39. Too Much Build-Up → Early Intellectual Hook
* Bad: "Let me give some context before I explain…"
* Corrected: "We thought the constraint was capital. It wasn't. It was trust inside a system designed to fail quietly. Want to see what cracked it open?"

40. Explaining the Org → Inviting Into the Design
* Bad: "Our mission is to empower…"
* Corrected: "We're building a structure that might work — if we get one hard part right. That's where we think you come in."

## LEVERAGE & OPENINGS

41. Unexamined Giving Pattern → Underlying Fear
* Bad: "She's focused on narrative change."
* Corrected: "She's afraid the story's already being written without her — and the only thing scarier than being wrong is being invisible."

42. Misinterpreted Quietness → High-Trust Processing
* Bad: "He's hard to read."
* Corrected: "If he's quiet, he's logging risk. If he replies two days later with a reframed version of your point — he's already in."

43. Absent "Why Now" → Latent Risk Signal
* Bad: "They've given to climate since 2016."
* Corrected: "Their giving hasn't changed in eight years — which means either they're loyal, or no one's made them update the map."

44. "Just a Donor" Framing → Co-Architect Language
* Bad: "We'd love for her to support the work."
* Corrected: "She's spent 10 years building rulesets no one sees. We want her fingerprints on this one — not just her endorsement."

45. Savior Trap → Humility Lever
* Bad: "He has the power to change the system."
* Corrected: "He knows he helped build the system. What he funds now is the version that might break the part he benefited from."

## TEXTURE AND VIBE TUNING

46. Too Formal in Section 7 → Dinner Table Intimacy
* Bad: "In a dinner setting, they are thoughtful and reserved."
* Corrected: "If the room is competent, they'll let loose. If it's all résumé theater, they'll order the check early."

47. Empty "Peer-Like Conversation" Guidance
* Bad: "They prefer peer-like conversation."
* Corrected: "Treat them like a peer in a design lab — not a peer at brunch. They want your sharpest questions, not your warmth."

48. Under-specified Rhythm Guidance
* Bad: "Keep the meeting structured."
* Corrected: "Start fast. Slow down once they start mapping your logic aloud — that's where the commitment forms."

49. One-Note Praise → Specific Admiration Hook
* Bad: "She's respected for her philanthropy."
* Corrected: "She's admired because she names the cost while others sell the dream. Start with a tradeoff — she'll trust you more."

50. No Post-Pitch Drift Management
* Bad: [Silence after pitch]
* Corrected: "If the silence stretches, don't fill it. Ask: 'Is there a part you're resisting?' That's where the real meeting starts."
