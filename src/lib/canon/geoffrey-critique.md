# Geoffrey's Critique Voice — 73 Correction Examples

These are examples of how Geoffrey corrects donor profiles. Each shows a bad bullet and the corrected version. Use these to pattern-match against the draft and produce specific, bullet-level rewrites.

## TONE & STYLE

1. Generic Praise → Specific Insight
* Bad: "She is a committed philanthropist who cares about justice and equity."
* Corrected: "She sees equity not as an outcome, but as a process of design — often backing projects that let her test structural interventions at scale."

2. Descriptive Bio → Behavioral Reading
* Bad: "He worked in journalism before becoming a tech entrepreneur."
* Corrected: "His journalism background shaped his deep suspicion of centralized narrative control — which now shows up in his discomfort with influencer-style storytelling."

3. Moral Flattery → Tactical Empathy
* Bad: "She's on the right side of history and uses her wealth for good."
* Corrected: "She's trying to reconcile her proximity to elite finance with a genuine desire to redistribute risk — and she funds people who seem to have figured that out."

4. Neutral Language → Slightly Dangerous Precision
* Bad: "He often supports groups that align with his values."
* Corrected: "He funds organizers who say the thing he's too reputationally exposed to say himself — and he knows it."

## STRUCTURE & ARCHITECTURE

5. Resume Summary in Section 1 → Strategic Identity
* Bad: "She went to Yale, worked in private equity, and now focuses on climate philanthropy."
* Corrected: "She uses her Yale-private-equity lineage not to distance herself from power, but to reformat it — often backing interventions that make elite institutions legible and accountable."

6. Loose "Motivations" Section → Causal Narrative
* Bad: "He believes in systemic change and is passionate about civic engagement."
* Corrected: "He's driven by the fear that civic disengagement creates a vacuum only authoritarianism can fill — and he funds efforts that reattach people to agency."

7. Vague "Dinner Party" Observations → Behavioral Contrast
* Bad: "They'd hate sitting next to someone who talked too much about themselves."
* Corrected: "They'd tune out the moment someone started listing credentials — but would lean in if someone asked 'When did it last feel like the work actually mattered to you?'"

8. One-dimensional Risk Factors → Layered Contradictions
* Bad: "She might resist being pitched directly."
* Corrected: "She claims to hate being pitched — but is flattered when the pitch is framed as a co-designed risk. Her resistance isn't to being asked — it's to being handled."

9. Trait List → Behavioral Cluster
* Bad: "● Self-Described Nerd Who Wields Awkwardness ● Customer Service Identity as Power Source ● Accidental Entrepreneur Who Tests for Mythology Resistance"
* Corrected: "He leads with ordinariness — nerd jokes, service stories, luck narratives — not to disarm but to filter. Get concrete and he opens up. Perform reverence and he stays polite. One move, not three."

10. Academic Header → Leverage Point Lead
* Bad: "● Conflict Avoidance Through Procedural Complexity — When confronted with direct disagreement, she redirects into process questions..."
* Corrected: "She doesn't argue — she disappears. If she disagrees at a values level, she won't push back. She'll add complexity, defer to someone else, or nod and go quiet. If you don't catch the shift, you'll leave thinking it went well."

11. Diagnostic Description → Power Function
* Bad: "He prefers to fund individual organizations and then encourage them to collaborate, rather than building centralized coalitions."
* Corrected: "He funds node by node and hopes a network forms — but he won't orchestrate it himself. That's not humility; it's how he maintains influence without accountability for the shape of the whole."

12. Symmetrical Sections → Tension-Weighted Structure
* Bad: "● Access to Elite Networks — She maintains relationships across... ● Deep Knowledge of Climate Policy — Her background in... ● Commitment to Grassroots Voice — She consistently..."
* Corrected: Lead with the bullet that has the most strategic consequence. Give it twice the space. Let the others be shorter. If every bullet in a section is the same length, the writer hasn't decided what matters most.

## PSYCHOLOGY & CONTRADICTION

13. Missing Contradiction → Identified Leverage
* Bad: [No contradiction identified]
* Corrected: "She publicly champions distributed leadership, but all her major giving has gone to single-leader orgs she can control. That tension is your opening — invite her into a leadership model that makes her nervous."

14. Confused Moral/Strategic Identity → Clean Internal Map
* Bad: "He's values-driven but pragmatic."
* Corrected: "He performs pragmatism in public but makes decisions emotionally — especially when a project hits a fear he won't name."

15. Over-smoothing Power Analysis → Sharp Posture Calibration
* Bad: "She holds a lot of influence and is known to support innovative models."
* Corrected: "She reads as a horizontal actor, but exerts control through network shaping and scarcity signaling. If you don't name the constraint she's protecting, she won't show up."

16. Overindexed Control Frame → Unacknowledged Vulnerability
* Bad: "She likes to be in control."
* Corrected: "Control is how she protects against irrelevance. Every constraint she imposes is a map of what she no longer understands."

17. Missing Conflict Aversion Pattern
* Bad: "He prefers harmony."
* Corrected: "He funds confrontation but avoids it personally — which means he backs fighters, but stays just far enough away not to get hit."

18. Overreliance on Self-Described Identity
* Bad: "He describes himself as a bridge-builder."
* Corrected: "He says 'bridge-builder,' but his funding goes one way. He doesn't want to connect worlds — he wants to be the person both sides need."

19. Unexamined Pattern of Exits
* Bad: "She transitioned out of leadership roles to focus on philanthropy."
* Corrected: "She exits when authorship disappears. If she can't shape it, she funds it — from a safe remove."

20. Ignoring Overcompensation Clues
* Bad: "He funds underdog efforts."
* Corrected: "He backs scrappy teams that still defer to him. He's not looking for rebellion — he's looking for sharp operators who'll let him rewrite the end."

21. Conflicting Evidence Smoothed → Tension Named as Signal
* Bad: "While she has occasionally expressed skepticism about institutional philanthropy, her deep commitment to the sector is evident in her long tenure on multiple foundation boards."
* Corrected: "She critiques institutional philanthropy publicly while serving on three foundation boards. This isn't hypocrisy — it's the contradiction. She believes the sector is failing but can only repair it from inside. If the asker names it, they'll get a real conversation."

22. Class-Level Contradiction → Individual Architectural Contradiction
* Bad: "She is caught between her commitment to social justice and her position within elite institutions that perpetuate inequality."
* Corrected: "She built her career translating community priorities into institutional language — and now the institutions absorb that language without changing. Her contradiction isn't justice vs. privilege. It's that her translation skill may have become the inoculation mechanism."

## MEETING DESIGN & PITCH

23. Overly Formal Tactics → Context-Calibrated Moves
* Bad: "Send a follow-up deck after the meeting."
* Corrected: "Send her a single paragraph titled 'The thing we haven't solved yet' — she'll reply if it smells like unsolved architecture."

24. Pitch-Led Openings → Tension-Led Entrances
* Bad: "Open with your mission and background."
* Corrected: "Open with: 'There's a constraint we haven't cracked yet. We think you've seen this before. Can I show you what we're stuck on?'"

25. Generic Close → Co-Creation Invitation
* Bad: "Ask if they'd like to be involved."
* Corrected: "Say: 'You're one of the few people who could shape the rules of this. Would you help pressure-test the architecture?'"

26. Too-Soon Ask → Relationship Calibration
* Bad: "End the meeting with a specific funding ask."
* Corrected: "End with: 'Can I send you the three options we're debating, and the one failure mode we haven't solved? I'd love to know where you'd push.'"

27. Vague "We'd Love Your Input" → Defined Thinking Invitation
* Bad: "We'd welcome your advice."
* Corrected: "We're caught between two bad options. You've probably faced this tradeoff — what did you wish someone had told you then?"

28. No Cadence Plan → Sequenced Engagement Design
* Bad: "Stay in touch with updates."
* Corrected: "Send a 2-paragraph update every 2 weeks — not to impress, but to let him watch you think in motion."

29. One-Mode Ask → Optional Entry Points
* Bad: "We're asking for $500K."
* Corrected: "$500K lets us run the full play. $150K gets us in the game. We'd rather start with a builder than a closer."

30. Too Much Build-Up → Early Intellectual Hook
* Bad: "Let me give some context before I explain…"
* Corrected: "We thought the constraint was capital. It wasn't. It was trust inside a system designed to fail quietly. Want to see what cracked it open?"

31. Explaining the Org → Inviting Into the Design
* Bad: "Our mission is to empower…"
* Corrected: "We're building a structure that might work — if we get one hard part right. That's where we think you come in."

## RHETORIC & FRAMING

32. Values Without Stakes → Cost of Inaction
* Bad: "He believes in equity and fairness."
* Corrected: "He funds equity efforts because he's seen what happens when people believe the game is rigged — and stop playing."

33. Safe Framing → Intellectually Brave Claims
* Bad: "They support new models of leadership."
* Corrected: "They're fascinated by leaderless organizing — not because it works yet, but because it's the only model they haven't already tried and outgrown."

34. Sympathy Without Strategic Use → Weaponized Empathy
* Bad: "She's personally connected to the issue."
* Corrected: "She doesn't want her personal story told — she wants to feel like her story is already embedded in the model."

35. Clinical Language → Operational Language
* Bad: "His core shame trigger is being unprepared for or misunderstanding the systems he's trying to influence."
* Corrected: "He steps back when the system breaks in ways he can't model. If there's no debug path, he won't escalate — he'll go quiet and stay that way. Show him where the intervention point is."

36. Template Script → Room-Ready Script
* Bad: "Open with: 'We think worker organizing is breaking because the information infrastructure is designed to fail. What did you learn about when peer-to-peer systems hold versus when they collapse?'"
* Corrected: "'This works in some shops but fails in ones with surveillance culture. We think the difference is peer signal latency — but we're still testing it.' Then pause. If he leans in, you're in a real meeting."

37. Reverse-Engineered Logic → Emotional Trigger
* Bad: "Veteran Support as National Security Infrastructure — He watches for who treats veteran support as charity versus who understands it as national security infrastructure."
* Corrected: "He funds veterans because he believes the country broke a promise — and he's angry about it. Frame military family struggles as systemic betrayal, not individual hardship, and he stops being a donor and starts being a co-conspirator."

## DANGEROUS TRUTH & DINNER TEST

38. Missing Dangerous Truth → Disarming Honesty
* Bad: [No dangerous truth]
* Corrected: "He'd never say it in public, but he thinks most movement groups are emotionally righteous and operationally hollow. He funds the ones that prove him wrong."

39. Flat Dinner Party → Social Chemistry Design
* Bad: "They enjoy relaxed conversation."
* Corrected: "They'd be bored by résumé theater but light up in a late-night riff about where power actually lives. Tone: dry, conspiratorial, one glass of wine in."

40. Polite Risk Factors → Dangerous Truth
* Bad: "Over-Solicitation Fatigue With Boundary Collapse — Partners who mistake his accessibility for unlimited availability get quietly managed out of direct access."
* Corrected: "He won't say no — he'll just disappear. If you force access, he'll automate the gate. You'll find out when your emails start getting answered by staff."

41. Personal Fear as Dangerous Truth → Civic-Scale Dangerous Truth
* Bad: "His dangerous truth is that he fears becoming irrelevant as a new generation of philanthropists emerges with different priorities."
* Corrected: "He believes the governance systems he helped build are producing the fragility they were designed to prevent. His dangerous truth isn't about himself — it's about what happens when the people responsible for repair can't diagnose the failure."

## LANGUAGE (MICRO)

42. "They care about…" → "They need to…"
* Bad: "She cares about climate justice."
* Corrected: "She needs to feel like climate work isn't being hijacked by purity performance — that it's designing for durability."

43. "They believe in…" → "They've bet on…"
* Bad: "He believes in collective action."
* Corrected: "He's made repeated bets on infrastructure that outlasts any single organizer — especially when the work disappears from headlines."

44. "They support…" → "They're watching for…"
* Bad: "She supports criminal justice reform."
* Corrected: "She's watching for who can turn pilot programs into political leverage — not just services, but permission to scale."

## FORMAT & CANON

45. Profile Sections Out of Canon → Resequenced into 7-Section Format
* Bad: Two overlapping sections: "Values" and "Beliefs."
* Corrected: Clean consolidation into "Core Motivations, Values, and Triggers" as per the canonical 3-pager format.

46. Missing Posture Calibrations in Section 3 → Explicit Posture Guidance
* Bad: "They like peer-level conversation."
* Corrected: "Posture: peer-to-peer, but with reverence for rigor. Treat them like a skeptical co-founder, not a donor or audience."

47. Soft Meeting Openings → Architecture-First Framing
* Bad: "Lead with background and what brought you here."
* Corrected: "Lead with: 'We're building a mechanism that could work — if we get one hard part right. That's why we're here.'"

## NARRATIVE & LEVERAGE

48. Missing Stakes → Urgency without Alarmism
* Bad: "They're concerned about the state of democracy."
* Corrected: "They believe we are already downstream of the crisis — and the real question is whether anyone still has the nerve to act like the clock is real."

49. Broad Description of Change → Causal Mechanism
* Bad: "She supports systemic solutions."
* Corrected: "She only moves when she can see pressure, leverage, and a point of entry. If it's not an engineered system, it's a slogan."

50. Legacy Talk as Flattery → Legacy as Leverage
* Bad: "This would be a legacy-defining investment."
* Corrected: "She doesn't want a legacy; she wants to disappear into something permanent. Offer her the piece she can build that no one else sees yet."

51. Change Agent as Hero → Change Agent as Frame-Breaker
* Bad: "He likes to support courageous leaders."
* Corrected: "He bets on people who disrupt the gameboard just long enough to redraw the rules — not because it's brave, but because it's structurally smart."

52. Unexamined Giving Pattern → Underlying Fear
* Bad: "She's focused on narrative change."
* Corrected: "She's afraid the story's already being written without her — and the only thing scarier than being wrong is being invisible."

53. Absent "Why Now" → Latent Risk Signal
* Bad: "They've given to climate since 2016."
* Corrected: "Their giving hasn't changed in eight years — which means either they're loyal, or no one's made them update the map."

54. "Just a Donor" Framing → Co-Architect Language
* Bad: "We'd love for her to support the work."
* Corrected: "She's spent 10 years building rulesets no one sees. We want her fingerprints on this one — not just her endorsement."

55. Savior Trap → Humility Lever
* Bad: "He has the power to change the system."
* Corrected: "He knows he helped build the system. What he funds now is the version that might break the part he benefited from."

## TEXTURE & VIBE

56. Too Formal in Section 7 → Dinner Table Intimacy
* Bad: "In a dinner setting, they are thoughtful and reserved."
* Corrected: "If the room is competent, they'll let loose. If it's all résumé theater, they'll order the check early."

57. Under-specified Rhythm Guidance
* Bad: "Keep the meeting structured."
* Corrected: "Start fast. Slow down once they start mapping your logic aloud — that's where the commitment forms."

58. One-Note Praise → Specific Admiration Hook
* Bad: "She's respected for her philanthropy."
* Corrected: "She's admired because she names the cost while others sell the dream. Start with a tradeoff — she'll trust you more."

59. No Post-Pitch Drift Management
* Bad: [Silence after pitch]
* Corrected: "If the silence stretches, don't fill it. Ask: 'Is there a part you're resisting?' That's where the real meeting starts."

## RETREAT PATTERNS

60. Generic "They Might Disengage" → Named Retreat Motion
* Bad: "She may become disengaged if the conversation doesn't align with her values."
* Corrected: "She retreats through affirmation. The warmer she gets without adding structure, the further she's already gone. If you hear 'this is great work' twice without a follow-up question, the live part of the meeting is over."

61. Missing Authorship Deflection Pattern
* Bad: "He tends to refer people to other organizations when he's not fully aligned."
* Corrected: "When he says 'you should talk to X,' he's not connecting you — he's exiting without saying no. The referral is a surrogate rejection. Test it: ask what specifically X would add that he can't. If he can't answer, the meeting is already over."

62. Abstraction as Engagement → Abstraction as Exit
* Bad: "She sometimes moves to high-level values language when discussing specifics."
* Corrected: "When she floats upward — 'this work matters,' 'we need more of this' — she's not reflecting. She's leaving. Abstraction after concrete engagement is a withdrawal signal. Re-anchor in a constraint or let the meeting close gracefully."

63. "Enthusiastic But Non-Committal" Treated as Positive → High Motion Low Commitment
* Bad: "He's very engaged and full of ideas — a great brainstorming partner who could become a strong ally."
* Corrected: "He generates ideas and names connections enthusiastically — but none of it is self-investing. Ten ideas and zero commitments means the motion was performance. Name one authorship lane and ask if he wants to hold it."

64. Risk-Triggered Stillness Misread as Thoughtfulness
* Bad: "He becomes more thoughtful and careful when the stakes get higher, which shows he takes the work seriously."
* Corrected: "When exposure enters the frame, he goes still. Questions shift from curious to procedural. This isn't depth — it's a threshold being crossed. Restore choice: slow the work, reduce the exposure, or propose a smaller test."

## ENGAGEMENT TELLS

65. One-Size-Fits-All Ask → Yes-Texture-Matched Ask
* Bad: "Ask her to support the work with a $250K commitment over two years."
* Corrected: "She enters through shaping, not endorsing. Expose a brittle part of the design and invite her to pressure-test it. A dollar amount before she's touched the architecture will feel transactional and she'll defer."

66. Missing "What Kind of Yes Is Forming" Diagnostic
* Bad: "She seems interested and we should follow up soon."
* Corrected: "She asked two edge-case questions and corrected one of your phrases with humor. That's a trust-formation pattern. The yes forming is skeptical-precision: she wants to fix blind spots, not validate the vision. Follow up with what's broken, not what works."

67. Surface Behavior Reported → Tell Decoded
* Bad: "He often asks detailed questions about implementation during meetings."
* Corrected: "He interrupts polished presentations with granular operational questions — not to be difficult but to test whether the work is real. If you welcome the derailment, he stays. If you try to get back to the deck, he marks you as unserious."

68. Praise at Face Value → Disengagement Tell
* Bad: "She praised the framing early in the conversation, which suggests strong alignment."
* Corrected: "Early praise followed by topic drift is a disengagement tell — she decided quickly this wasn't for her. If you hear 'this is helpful' twice, stop pitching and ask what's not landing."

69. Silence Treated Uniformly → Silence Decoded by Context
* Bad: "He tends to be quiet and reflective in meetings."
* Corrected: "His silence has two modes. After a strong point, he goes quiet to process — comes back two days later with a reframed version. After an exposure moment, he goes quiet to exit — follow-up email gets answered by staff. The difference is what preceded the silence."

70. Ghost Likelihood Absent → Ghosting Pattern Encoded
* Bad: "Follow up within a week to maintain momentum."
* Corrected: "His ghost signature: praise + referral to someone else + topic change in the follow-up email. If you see all three, he's gone. If he forgets a detail but recalls a specific example from the meeting, he's processing. Send the constraint memo and wait."

## PRESENCE & VOLTAGE

71. Generic Engagement Style → Presence Pattern
* Bad: "She prefers substantive, collaborative conversations and responds well to direct communication."
* Corrected: "Diagnostic presence. She interrupts to stress-test logic and escalates precision when stakes rise. Don't build rapport first — lead with the hardest part of the design. If you start with warmth, she'll read it as padding."

72. Missing Conflict Reflex → Interruption Pattern Decoded
* Bad: "He can be challenging in conversations and sometimes pushes back on ideas."
* Corrected: "He interrupts only to correct logic, never to assert status. If you absorb the correction and adjust, he reads it as strength. If you defend, he reads it as rigidity and starts planning his exit."

73. Missing Emotional Voltage → Voltage Mismatch Warning
* Bad: "He appreciates both analytical discussions and personal stories."
* Corrected: "Low voltage, high precision. Stories land only when they explain a system breakdown. Warmth before rigor marks you as unserious. Start analytical; let the human stakes emerge from the mechanics."
