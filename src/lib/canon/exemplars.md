# PERSUASION PROFILE — CRAIG NEWMARK

## Life and Career

His father died when he was thirteen. His Sunday School teachers — Holocaust survivors, both of them — taught him two rules: treat people the way you want to be treated, and know when enough is enough. These aren't values he adopted. They're the operating system. Everything since — Craigslist, the philanthropy, the Giving Pledge, the pigeons — runs on firmware installed in a New Jersey Sunday School before he could drive.

He grew up "hovering not far above poverty," occasionally digging into savings for groceries. He "really did wear a plastic pocket protector" and "thick black glasses taped together." He was on the debate team, where he developed what he calls "dangerous illusions about the power of reason and logic." The nerd origin story is unusually literal — and unusually structural. When he calls himself a nerd at seventy-three, he's not performing humility. He's referencing an identity that was fixed before he had any choice in the matter and has never been revised.

A community email list for San Francisco tech events accidentally became a platform generating hundreds of millions in revenue. He turned down $11 billion in monetization offers, stepped away from management in 2000, stayed in customer service until 2018, then moved entirely to philanthropy. He married Eileen Whelpley in 2012, lives between San Francisco and New York, and signed the Giving Pledge on his seventy-third birthday in December 2025.

## Who They Think They Are

The nerd identity is both completely authentic and completely architectural. "I'm an old-school nerd helping to protect the people who protect our country" — this isn't humility, it's who he needs to be in order to operate. He defines himself by what he can't do (manage, socialize, read people) rather than what he accomplished (building Craigslist, accumulating billions). By pre-announcing every limitation, he controls the terms of every interaction. You can't outmaneuver someone who has already conceded every point you might use as leverage.

"Even now, I'm only faking social skills" and "I can't read people, and I take them too literally." These disclosures clear the field. The only things left to evaluate are operational competence and moral alignment — which happen to be the only two things he can reliably judge.

But the nerd identity also lets him do enormous things without having to own them as power moves. It lets him deploy hundreds of millions of dollars while claiming to be "not that big a deal." It lets him rename journalism schools after himself while framing it as institutional credibility rather than personal legacy. Every massive commitment can be processed as "just a nerd doing his part" rather than a billionaire exercising power. Without the nerd frame, the scale of his interventions would require a different self-narrative — one he has never built and shows no interest in building.

## What They Value Most

His values are organized around a single diagnosis: American democratic infrastructure is under distributed attack that doesn't resemble traditional warfare, and the institutions that should be defending it either don't see the threat or can't organize against it. Cybersecurity threats are "like World War II except that the enemy is already here." Journalism is "the immune system of democracy." These aren't metaphors — they're how he actually sees the decay happening.

The hierarchy: national security (protecting those who protect the country) above democratic institutions (journalism, voter protection) above social equity (women in tech, veteran support) above personal interests (pigeon rescue). The categories are integrated around a single principle of protecting people who serve others.

## Where to Start

The central contradiction: he built one of the most successful platforms in internet history while maintaining he "kinda sucks" as a manager and lacks business acumen. He consistently attributes Craigslist's success to luck, yet his philanthropic portfolio demonstrates sophisticated pattern recognition that luck doesn't explain. The nerd who can't read people has assembled a network of domain experts across cybersecurity, journalism, and veteran advocacy who execute his moral framework with minimal oversight. That's not an accident. That's someone who built a system to route around limitations he can see with perfect clarity — and the system works better than most people's direct management.

He genuinely can't do the thing he says he can't do. He genuinely has built a system that doesn't require him to do it. Both are true simultaneously. When he retreats — routing to intermediaries, delegating to proven networks — that's the system working, not avoidance. He funds at scale, withdraws from operations, and has his name associated with the durable result. Organizations that deliver results while requiring nothing from him beyond resources hit this need precisely. Those requiring his participation — board seats, strategy sessions, speaking engagements — are asking for the one resource he has never been willing to deploy: sustained personal presence.

The invisibility narrative needs correction, however. He says he doesn't want profile, but his behavior says otherwise — regular LinkedIn posts, high-profile press coverage, a journalism school bearing his name. He'll accept public acknowledgment when it's framed as service to the mission but not when it's framed as personal celebration. He accepts far more visibility than the "invisible nerd" narrative suggests, which matters for anyone designing an ask that includes naming, public credit, or institutional association.

## What Moves Them

He is highly susceptible to influence from domain experts within his focus areas — Anne Marie Dougherty on veteran needs, cybersecurity professionals framing infrastructure threats — and completely resistant to influence outside them. He doesn't want to be convinced of new causes. He wants to be shown superior execution within commitments he's already made.

He is a pure builder. He funds infrastructure — journalism schools, veteran support networks, cybersecurity systems — and never funds confrontation, advocacy campaigns, or public pressure. If your ask is framed as a fight, you've lost him. If it's framed as building a durable system that protects people, you're speaking his language.

He is not influenced by vision, inspiration, charisma, or strategic brilliance. He is influenced by operational competence demonstrated within moral categories he has already accepted. This is the most important sentence in this profile for anyone trying to move him.

## How They Decide

He decides in three stages. First, you have to demonstrate operational competence within one of his moral categories — cybersecurity, journalism, veterans, voter protection. That's the threshold. Without it, no amount of logic gets you in.

Second, the nerd identity has to hold. It lets him authorize enormous commitments without having to see himself as a power player. If the interaction forces him to acknowledge that he's wielding power rather than just helping out, the commitment stalls.

Third, when both conditions are met, the commitment is large, immediate, and unconditional. His early philanthropy was "scattershot"; instead of expanding, he narrowed to areas where he could reliably judge competence and refused to operate outside that zone.

The numbers — $100 million to cybersecurity, $100 million to veteran support, then doubled based on results — are not deliberated. Once the moral category is clear, the decision is already made.

## How They Build Trust

The Markup failure is the scar that governs how carefully he trusts now. He gave $20 million to a journalism startup that imploded due to leadership conflicts. The response was architectural: he now routes every major commitment through established intermediaries. Bob Woodruff Foundation for veterans. ProPublica for journalism. Proven networks for cybersecurity. If your organization reads as a promising experiment rather than a proven operation, it triggers the Markup pattern.

The operational trust test is tolerance for his communication style: "people who can tolerate my sense of humor." This is a filter for compatibility — people who need rapport-building, contextual warmth, or diplomatic scaffolding can't work with him because he doesn't operate that way.

The asker's posture matters more than the pitch. He classifies people within minutes as operators he can fund or noise he needs to route around. Don't pitch. Don't inspire. Don't build rapport. Show him you understand the problem operationally, name it in his moral category, and let him classify you as someone competent enough to receive resources.

## What Sets Them Off

He is triggered by the Craigslist-destroyed-journalism narrative: "People throw the accusation. I look at the facts and stick with that." Don't implicate tech broadly in his presence. He'll hear the accusation he's been fighting for a decade, and the meeting shifts from assessment to self-defense.

When he's triggered, he doesn't get aggressive. He stays warm and reroutes you. "Talk to Anne Marie." "Send it to Bob Woodruff Foundation." The pleasantness is real. So is the distance. If you notice him redirecting to intermediaries mid-meeting when he wasn't before, you've hit something. The recovery move is to return to operational specifics within his moral framework — not to address the trigger directly.

He is also triggered by visible failures in protecting vulnerable people — food insecurity among military families, inadequate cybersecurity for critical infrastructure — moments that activate the core fear that the system is failing and no one is organizing the defense.

## Where They Draw Lines

He provides resources and expects complete autonomy. He won't micromanage, provide strategic guidance, rescue failing initiatives, join boards, or attend events. If your model requires ongoing donor involvement, you've disqualified yourself.

## How They Communicate

Deliberately compressed. "Hey," "folks," and immediate transition to concrete specifics. No rapport, no context, no emotional scaffolding. Match his compression. Lead with numbers and operational specifics. If you open with vision or inspiration, you're speaking a language his system doesn't process.

## How They Commit

No pilots. No phased approaches. No milestones. When he decides, he provides significant resources immediately — $100 million to veteran support, then another $100 million based on results. Only fundamental mission drift triggers exit. He funds competent people, watches the machine run, and wants his name associated with the durable result.

## How They Think About Resources

Concentrated deployment within a spend-down framework. Large commitments to a few areas at seventy-three with the Giving Pledge signed. Additional wealth above sufficiency is "a burden" to be deployed, not accumulated.

## What They'll Risk

Extremely high financial risk within his focus areas, zero tolerance for scope expansion. The Markup failure didn't reduce journalism funding — it shifted method from new ventures to established organizations. He metabolized the failure as information about method, not mission.

## How They Build Relationships

Functional, intermediary-buffered, and minimal — the same routing-around-limitations approach that governs everything else in this profile.

## How They Think About Time

He is operating in "Now" mode with emerging legacy awareness. The urgency is real: cybersecurity and disinformation are immediate crises, and at seventy-three he wants to "spend everything during my lifetime." But the journalism school naming, the Giving Pledge timing, the profile cultivation — these suggest he's not just spending down. He's spending down in a way that will be identified with him. If you can frame your work as both urgent and durable — a crisis response that becomes a lasting institution — you've hit his temporal sweet spot.

## How They Read Status

He accepts recognition framed as service — the journalism school naming helps the school recruit — and deflects recognition framed as celebration — galas, awards, spotlights. The "invisible nerd" narrative understates how much public identification he'll tolerate, as long as it passes through the nerd frame: helping, not wielding.

## How They Learn

Historical pattern matching, not analysis. Cybersecurity is "World War II except the enemy is already here." Journalism is "the immune system of democracy." These frames come from high school history, not policy study. Frame your work in his analogies, not yours.

## What They Know

Deep on internet infrastructure from building Craigslist. Shallow on everything he funds. He knows it, names it, and delegates accordingly.

# PERSUASION PROFILE — ROY BAHAT

---

## Life and Career

Roy Bahat didn't climb a career ladder. He moved laterally across fault lines — media, tech platforms, venture capital, academia, labor — staying long enough to learn each institution's logic, never long enough to be captured by it. Rhodes Scholar in economics at Oxford. President of IGN Entertainment. Digital strategy at News Corp. Then Bloomberg offered him a venture fund in 2013 and he said yes despite, by his own account, not liking VCs.

Bloomberg Beta is a $75 million fund backed exclusively by Bloomberg L.P., focused on the future of work and machine intelligence. Early investments in Slack, MasterClass, Flexport, Codecademy — companies where technology reshapes how people work. He teaches media and organized labor at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, hosts Labor Notes conferences while managing Bloomberg's capital, and references his wife's work delivering babies when someone suggests technology should reinvent everything. VC who teaches labor organizing. Capitalist who believes worker power creates demand. Fund manager who open-sourced his entire operating model on GitHub.

## Who They Think They Are

Bahat needs to be uncategorizable. That's not a personality trait — it's how he operates. "I don't consider myself to be a particularly ideological person." This is not accurate — someone who spends a decade on "making work work," teaches labor organizing at a business school, and takes publicly unpopular positions has an ideology. But if he admits it, he becomes sortable — progressive, activist, labor-aligned — and therefore dismissible by the institutional players he needs in the room. If he's pragmatic, he can sit at every table. His Medium alignment is "Neutral good" — ethical commitment without partisan positioning. His career is "messy." He "doesn't even like VCs." None of these are contradictions he's blind to. They're the space between worlds working — letting him convene Labor Notes organizers and Bloomberg executives in the same orbit without either group disqualifying him.

He sees the same structural pattern across domains most people treat as opposed: "I'm drawn to entrepreneurs... they are underdogs trying to prove something when the odds are stacked against them. I'm drawn to the stories of these labor organizers for exactly the same reason." Entrepreneurs and labor organizers, in his architecture, are the same actor in different contexts. The moment you categorize him — conventional VC, ideologue, theorist, someone whose career makes linear sense — you've told him you can't see the space he occupies, and if you can't see it, you can't be trusted with anything that requires it.

## What They Value Most

"Work is broken in America, and it is tearing our society apart." This isn't advocacy language. It's how he sees things breaking — the institution that gives most people economic security and daily meaning is fracturing in ways that undermine democratic society itself. When he evaluates an investment, a partnership, or an ask, the operative question is: does this make work work better for real people, or does it make the fracture worse?

"I think of worker power as a source of demand." If worker power creates markets, then supporting it is good capitalism, not charity or ideology — which lets him fund "exit to community" models without abandoning his fiduciary obligation to Bloomberg L.P. When someone frames labor as a cost center, they're revealing they operate with the model he's spent a decade replacing. The conversation continues. The evaluation is over.

His wife is a doctor who delivers babies. He brings this up when someone suggests technology should disrupt everything: "You don't really want to reinvent the wheel there, right?" The future-of-work thesis has a hard limit — not everything should be optimized, not everything should be rebuilt. Some forms of human work are sacred in their current form. He's not a techno-utopian. He's someone who believes some things are broken and need rebuilding while other things are working and need protecting from the people who can't tell the difference.

## Where to Start

Bahat has built his entire professional life around occupying the space between capital and labor, institution and disruption, power and critique — but the space only works if he never fully commits to either side. His deepest convictions can only be expressed as "pragmatism." His most powerful interventions must be framed as experiments rather than positions. The man who spends every professional hour on the belief that work is broken must introduce himself as not particularly ideological.

This isn't hypocrisy. It's structural necessity. The in-between space is the source of his power — convening people who'd never sit together, investing where conventional VCs won't, teaching labor organizing at a business school. But it has a cost: constant hedging. "Maybe in five years I'll have the data." "We might just be wrong." "I generally try to avoid predictions, because I think they're mostly lullabies." These aren't intellectual humility. They're the price of admission. If he claims certainty, he becomes categorizable. If he becomes categorizable, the space collapses.

Under pressure — pushed toward one side of any binary — he retreats into three moves: the hedging, scope limitation ("I'm hesitant to speak on their behalf"), and preemptive framing ("that's going to be an unpopular view, but it's my view"). The third is most revealing. He flags social cost before stating the position, which simultaneously claims the contrarian identity and softens the structural commitment. He's not saying "this is true." He's saying "this is my view and I know you might not like it" — keeping the position personal rather than categorical.

## What Moves Them

He's moved by practitioners who show him something he hasn't seen about a problem he already cares about. Not vision. Not rhetoric. His partner Cham says "don't be where the bot, be where the boss" and Bahat absorbs the framework, repeats it across interviews, integrates it into his investment logic. He doesn't generate original frameworks. He recognizes them in practitioners and amplifies them.

He hears unmet need and thinks simultaneously about company formation and labor organizing: "it's this great force of people wanting to make a new technology or of people wanting to organize." If you can speak in both registers at once — this is a market and this is a justice problem — you're speaking his native language. If you can only speak one, you've already been sorted. This is the most important sentence in this profile for anyone trying to move him: arrive with a framework grounded in practice that connects individual opportunity to systemic repair, and his posture shifts from evaluation to absorption.

Industry convention triggers immediate rejection — artificial delays, strategic ambiguity, pitch-deck polish. He built his entire fund to route around it.

## How They Decide

He decides in three stages. First, you have to know the problem from the inside. "We have passed on companies because we did not think the founders were crazy enough." He's looking for conviction that only comes from having seen the problem up close and refused to accept it.

Second, the uncategorizable identity has to hold. Once that first condition is met, he can commit without needing a political narrative or institutional rationale. The unanimous-yes structure — "if anyone on the team says yes, we'll do it, there's no voting" — eliminates the committee filtering that would force each investment into a category.

Third, the commitment is immediate and sustained. "I could pretend to think about it and not email you for a week and then tell you. Or I can tell you right now." No is instant and unpadded. Yes is fast and durable. Slow bad news is cruelty disguised as process. Rushed good news is extraction disguised as urgency — one founder held an offer open for seven months without pressure. "Price is the dependent variable." When conviction is present, terms adjust. When it's absent, no terms work.

## How They Build Trust

Trust is a sorting mechanism, not a relationship stage. He delivers unfiltered feedback and watches the flinch. "Everyone wants you to be blunt and transparent until you're in the room with them." If you absorb directness and engage — push back, sharpen your position — you pass into his inner circle. If you retreat, deflect, or perform toughness, you've been sorted out.

He flips the VC-founder dynamic: provides tools for founders to evaluate investors, advocates they "do references" on VCs, open-sourced his entire fund model on GitHub. Founders who defer to the conventional power dynamic have failed his filter without knowing it.

Trust deepens through challenge. He positions himself as student — if you teach him something he didn't know, you've earned it. If you treat his models as correct rather than improvable, you've earned nothing.

## What Sets Them Off

Three triggers, ordered by severity.

Categorization. Standard pitch language, standard process assumptions, standard deference — he registers it as evidence you haven't understood what he is. No anger. Quiet reclassification: noise, not signal. The meeting continues. The evaluation doesn't.

Ungrounded positions. Advocacy for labor without understanding how companies operate, or for technology without understanding what it costs workers. Someone claiming the cross-domain credibility he has without having done the work across domains to earn it.

Missed precedence. "It always makes me crazy when I'm like, 'Oh, the first investor in the company, they're like, no, there was an angel in there before.'" The "makes me crazy" is unhedged in a way his other positions never are — the in-between space is supposed to give him vision that conventional positioning doesn't, and when it doesn't deliver, the identity absorbs a hit.

His defensive motion: he gets careful. Hedging multiplies, qualifications appear, scope narrows. Watch the ratio of clean declaratives to hedged statements. When it shifts, something has threatened the space he occupies.

## Where They Draw Lines

The Bloomberg LP relationship is the hardest structural constraint. "We aren't a strategic investor, but our LP cares about tech companies." "There are never companion deals." "We don't do financial services." Without these, the fund loses its credibility as independent. Push against them and you've confirmed his concern that people don't understand the independence he's maintaining.

"If a founder doesn't like directness, we are not their people." "I'm not one of them, so I'm hesitant to speak on their behalf." Both boundaries drawn at intake. The ethical boundary on investments operates upstream of financial analysis — companies that exploit workers or eliminate meaningful work never enter evaluation regardless of returns.

## How They Communicate

"There's a term of art in venture, they say he's just being slippery, and it's implied that some degree of being slippery is okay, maybe even good. Well that doesn't really work for me." He named the industry's default, rejected it, and built a fund that selects against it. When he's certain about a principle, you get clean declaratives. When he's about to say something contrarian, he flags the social cost first. When the topic moves to communities he's not part of, he narrows his scope. When he doesn't know an outcome, he deflects into time — "maybe in five years." The shifts between these modes are the tell.

## How They Commit

Binary and mission-anchored. "In the past decade, I have put that issue — making work work — at the centre of my professional life." Thirteen years teaching at Berkeley, exclusive Bloomberg LP across multiple fund cycles, annual Going to Work conference — parallel channels, same problem. When a founder's idea failed and she tried to return the capital, he refused and told her to keep building. Performance failure doesn't break the commitment. Mission drift does.

He enters early and stays. "$250,000 first check... get involved really early and remain valuable and invest much more over time." The uncertainty stage — where an investment could be visionary or delusional — is where someone with his between-worlds vantage is most comfortable and most useful.

## How They Think About Resources

Everything depends on worker power actually generating demand. If it does, "exit to community" models are market creation on a longer timeline. If it doesn't, the entire justification collapses back into conventional philanthropy — which his identity can't absorb. Resources beyond capital — Bloomberg's platform, customer access, technical infrastructure — are abundant once you've proven mission alignment, invisible before it.

## What They'll Risk

"At the seed stage, the risk of missing something is worse than the risk of investing in the wrong company." Bad investments lose money. Missed investments mean the thing he's built himself to be — the person who sees what conventional investors miss — failed at its core function. He designs for controversial investments: "the best deals tend to be controversial." He's metabolized the possibility of total failure: "there's some chance that you create something special. There's also a chance that you create something that blows up in your face." What he won't risk is the in-between space itself.

## How They Build Relationships

Reveals itself under stress. "Roy was, in her words, 'a rock'" during difficult periods — operational continuity, not emotional scaffolding. Harper Reed's testimonial, prefaced by "it'll embarrass him for me to post this," is what happens when people experience his directness over time and through difficulty. It converts into deep loyalty. If you're working on the problem, he's in the relationship. If you're not, the relationship was never about you personally.

## How They Think About Time

Two clocks. The venture clock: "a chess game, where every move is separated by a year to 18 months." The urgency clock: work is breaking now, AI is accelerating the fracture now, the window for new structures is closing now.

## How They Read Status

He accepts recognition that positions him as useful and deflects recognition that positions him as elevated. Teaching fits his self-image. Open-sourcing the fund fits. Public praise for character doesn't — because it fixes him in place as a person of achievement rather than a person in motion. He absorbs social cost for contrarian positions, but the preemptive framing — "that's going to be an unpopular view" — reveals he tracks the price. He pays it anyway. He needs you to know he knows.

## How They Learn

Practitioners, never analysts. Raw data, never presentations. "I'd rather be on the private Github repository of a startup... than have them bloviate on the state of the industry." The commit log can't perform. The board deck can. He trusts accordingly.

## What They Know

He saw AI as a future-of-work force before consensus formed — pattern recognition at the intersection, not technical depth. His competence spans domains without going deep in any: enough VC, enough labor organizing, enough media, enough economics. None specialist-grade. The value is the combination — connections between systems that specialists can't see because they're inside one, not between them.

# PERSUASION PROFILE — LORI McGLINCHEY

---

## Life and Career

The career doesn't read like a ladder. It reads like someone who keeps finding the same problem in different institutional clothing and staying until the institution catches up or she outgrows it.

Amherst College, American Studies — a discipline that trains you to read systems, not specialize in one. Then the Yiddish Book Center, where she produced a 13-hour NPR radio series on Eastern European Jewish literature — a co-production with KCRW that ran on half the NPR network and required coordinating high-profile talent around an unfashionable cause. Rescuing a language most people had written off. The instinct to build infrastructure for things the mainstream has abandoned shows up in everything she does afterward.

Open Society Foundations for roughly a decade, moving across programs that share a single structural pattern: the Project on Death in America ($45 million, credited with moving hospital palliative care units from zero to 75% coverage), then a special initiative on the politicization of science-based policymaking, then the U.S. Democracy Fund running media, internet policy, investigative journalism, and documentary film funding. At each stop, she built the connective tissue — a capacity-strengthening program for OSF grantees covering communications, governance, fundraising, leadership, and technology.

Ford Foundation since 2014. Director of the Technology and Society program: $14 million annual domestic budget, $7 million international, 118 grantees. Under her leadership, Ford secured a $50 million special allocation to create the PIT Catalyst Fund, launched the Public Interest Technology University Network with 36 institutions, co-created the Spyware Accountability Initiative with Apple, built the Disability x Tech Fund, and co-funded the $10 million Antimonopoly Fund. Total Ford commitment to public interest technology since 2016: over $100 million, with $150 million mobilized from co-funders.

Seven current governance positions, including the Partnership on AI (alongside Apple, Microsoft, Google DeepMind, and the ACLU), Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology, and the interim committee for Current AI (with MacArthur, Google DeepMind, and the French government). She sits in rooms where philanthropy, government, and industry negotiate the rules for AI, surveillance, and digital rights — and she sits there as both funder and governance participant. She shapes the field and then allocates capital within it.

## Who They Think They Are

She sees herself as a field-builder, not a funder. The distinction is structural. A funder picks winners. A field-builder creates the conditions under which winners can emerge — university pipelines, co-funding vehicles, cross-sector tables, governance seats that give civil society standing against corporate and state power.

The PIT Catalyst Fund is the clearest expression. It wasn't grants to individual organizations. It was a $50 million bet that if you train technologists across disciplines at universities, the universities will institutionalize the field after the money runs out. Finite. High-intensity. Designed to trigger institutional adoption, not perpetual grantmaking. When the fund spent its full allocation in three years, that was the plan.

She cannot tolerate being mistaken for a gatekeeper. The role she's built — convener, architect, coalition-designer — requires that she be understood as someone who distributes power rather than concentrates it. Her framing of the Antimonopoly Fund: "The greatest threat to monopoly power is distributed power, where a well-resourced field of advocates work across sectors with common purpose." That's not a comment on corporate concentration. It's a description of how she designs every initiative she runs.

## What They Value Most

Her read on what's broken: technology reproduces and accelerates existing inequality unless civil society has the technical capacity, institutional standing, and legal tools to intervene. The failure mode is specific — when the people most affected by technology are excluded from designing, governing, and regulating it, the technology entrenches the exclusion.

Her test for whether something passes: does it build permanent capacity in civil society, or does it create temporary dependence on philanthropic funding?

## Where to Start

The central contradiction: she builds coalitions to counterbalance concentrated power, but doing so requires her to work with the concentrators. Ford co-launched the Spyware Accountability Initiative with Apple — the same Apple whose app store policies, device ecosystems, and market position are subjects of the antimonopoly movement Ford also funds. She sits on Partnership on AI's board between the ACLU's deputy director for speech and privacy and Microsoft's Chief Responsible AI Officer.

This isn't hypocrisy. It's the structural logic of foundation-led field-building at the $16 billion endowment scale. Ford can't fund direct opposition to its own programmatic partners without destroying the web of partnerships she's spent a decade building. But it can fund the field conditions — university pipelines, civil rights tables, investigative journalism, legal infrastructure — that produce the opposition organically. The field does what the foundation can't say.

Under pressure — when the gap between the institutional language and the adversarial funding becomes visible — the decision record suggests she adds partners rather than takes positions. The Disability x Tech Fund was created with an advisory committee of people with disabilities who nominated and selected grantees. The Spyware Accountability Initiative has an independent global technical advisory committee. The Antimonopoly Fund is managed by the Economic Security Project, not Ford. When the work is politically exposed, she builds governance structures that distribute the risk and the decision authority.

## What Moves Them

She's moved by gaps — places where real people are doing real work without the architecture to sustain it. Public interest technology wasn't a named field when Ford started funding it. The Civil Rights, Privacy, and Technology Table bridged communities that had never worked together. The Disability x Tech Fund was explicitly about absence: "There's a relatively small roster of people and organizations with expertise in issues related to disability and technology, and the support for them is not large — it's not even modest."

When she told the Chronicle of Philanthropy "We had this civil-rights framing, yet we were missing a very significant component of civil rights," she was naming the gap that excited her, not a failure that embarrassed her. She needs proof of absence, not proof of concept.

The most important sentence in this profile for anyone trying to move her: if you show her a problem where practitioners exist but the field doesn't, and you're willing to build the architecture from zero with those practitioners leading the design, her posture shifts from evaluation to collaboration. She doesn't need to see a field. She needs to see the gap where a field should be.

## How They Decide

She decides in three stages. First, there has to be a visible gap between practitioners doing real work and the institutional infrastructure needed to sustain it. Real people already in the space without the architecture to connect, professionalize, or protect them.

Second, she needs co-funders. Almost nothing in her portfolio is Ford-only. The PIT Catalyst Fund mobilized $150 million in complementary funding. The Spyware Accountability Initiative launched with Apple, OSF, Okta for Good, and Craig Newmark Philanthropies. The European AI Fund has seventeen foundation partners. If she can't attract co-funders, the field isn't ready. Co-funding is both how she validates an opportunity and how she distributes risk.

Third, the commitment is finite, high-intensity, and designed for institutional adoption. The Catalyst Fund was three years, $50 million, spent in full. Not renewable. If the investment doesn't trigger permanent institutional change within the time window, more money won't fix the problem.

## How They Build Trust

The trust mechanism is delegation. She builds advisory committees, steering committees, independent governance structures — and populates them with practitioners, not funders. The logic: if Ford controls grantee selection, Ford is a gatekeeper. If an advisory committee of affected communities controls selection, Ford is infrastructure.

For the person entering a meeting: the trust test is whether you understand that power should flow through you to someone else, not accumulate with you. If your ask positions you as the expert Ford should back, you're speaking gatekeeper language. If your ask positions you as infrastructure that enables practitioners Ford can't reach directly, you're speaking her language.

## What Sets Them Off

The exclusion of affected communities from technology decisions that affect them. "The support for them is not large — it's not even modest." The second clause is the tell — it carries frustration at the philanthropic sector's failure, not just a funding gap. She built the Disability x Tech Fund specifically because Ford's own civil-rights framing had excluded disability for years. She named the institutional failure publicly. That takes a specific kind of anger.

Technological solutionism without power analysis. When someone presents technology as a solution without naming whose power it serves and whose it threatens, they've failed her test. Single-organization impact stories fail for the same reason — she funds fields, not programs.

Philanthropic siloing. The entire co-funding model she's built is designed to force foundations into shared strategy. Isolated foundation grantmaking is, in her view, a structural failure.

## Where They Draw Lines

Ford's institutional constraints are the hardest boundaries — the web of partnerships can't survive grants that contradict its own programmatic partners. These aren't her personal lines. They're non-negotiable.

The personal line is harder to see but absolute: the community most affected leads the design. Not consulted. Not included. Leads. Propose something designed for a community rather than by it and you've confirmed that you don't understand how she works.

## How They Communicate

She operates in two modes. The institutional one is precise, structural, power-literate, with no emotional valence. "Addressing the global spyware industry cannot be the work of any one company or funder or government; it requires an approach as interconnected as our world is today." Coalition language — it distributes agency, names the architecture, avoids positioning Ford as protagonist.

The candid mode is rare. "We had this civil-rights framing, yet we were missing a very significant component of civil rights." These sentences admit institutional failure and imply personal responsibility. They appear in the Chronicle of Philanthropy — a trade publication read by peers, not the general public. She's candid with the sector, institutional with the public.

[**Evidence ceiling:** Zero data on her verbal style in meetings, her listening patterns, or the tells embedded in shifts between modes. Both modes above are written, both in institutional contexts.]

## How They Commit

Over a decade at Ford in a single program area. The commitment is to the field, not the individual organization. Organizations receive Ford support, but the commitment is to the field the organization operates within. The Markup received $2.5 million not because Ford is loyal to The Markup but because investigative tech journalism is a field Ford is building. The distinction matters: if your organization drifts from the field's purpose, the commitment doesn't follow you.

## How They Think About Resources

What's scarce is not Ford's money. What's scarce is philanthropic coordination. The resource conversation with her is never about Ford's capital in isolation — it's about whether your work is positioned to attract a co-funding coalition.

## What They'll Risk

She'll risk Ford's institutional brand by partnering with corporations whose practices in other domains conflict with Ford's values. She'll risk philanthropic capital on finite, spend-down initiatives where the entire investment fails if institutional adoption doesn't happen within the time window.

She won't risk the coalition itself. That's the load-bearing structure — everything else she's built depends on it. A risk that threatens a single grantee is manageable. A risk that threatens the multi-foundation model threatens everything.

She admitted Ford's civil-rights framing excluded disability — a public acknowledgment of institutional failure that most program directors would avoid. She risks institutional embarrassment when the naming serves institutional learning. Narrow risk appetite — she doesn't risk for visibility or contrarianism, only for field correction.

## How They Build Relationships

If you're working on the problem inside her architecture, the relationship exists. If you're not, no amount of personal rapport substitutes.

## How They Think About Time

Two time horizons. The short one: three to five years — finite bets designed to catalyze permanent change. The long one: decades. The PIT movement traces to NetGain in 2015 and continues through Current AI in 2025. Her tenure at Ford matches the longer timeline.

The fundraiser should expect her to ask: what happens after our money runs out?

## How They Read Status

In over a decade at Ford running a $100 million-plus portfolio, her public footprint is remarkably thin — a handful of press release quotes, one blog post, a Bluesky bio, and governance committee listings. No podcasts. No op-eds. No conference appearances in her own name. The institutional voice speaks. She doesn't.

The status she accepts is governance authority: board seats, steering committees, advisory roles. Power without profile. Influence without attribution. Don't praise her. Don't cite her accomplishments. Treat her as the person who built the architecture and talk about what the architecture makes possible.

## How They Learn

The career arc — Yiddish Book Center to Project on Death in America to science policy to media and internet policy to technology and society — suggests she learns by moving across domains and finding the structural pattern that connects them. The common thread: institutions that should serve the public interest but don't, because the people most affected aren't in the room where decisions are made.

At Ford, she learns through structured evaluation — advisory committees, program evaluations, convenings. The 2018 Ford-Hewlett disinformation convening is the clearest example: 50-plus scholars, think tank leaders, funders, and platform representatives brainstorming research questions. The output was explicitly framed as "not a reflection of any plans or endorsements by the Ford or Hewlett foundations, or the participants themselves." She convenes the learning and lets the field own the conclusions.

## What They Know

Nobody in the technology-and-society philanthropy space has more structural knowledge of how foundations coordinate to build fields. She has built or co-built at least six major collaborative funding initiatives and sits on seven governance bodies. A decade building the connection between legacy civil rights organizations and the technology policy community gives her working command of that intersection.

AI governance, spyware and surveillance, disinformation, net neutrality, antimonopoly, and public interest technology — working depth across all of them. Technical implementation is absent from the record. She knows who builds technology and how to fund them. Whether she knows the technical substrate is not evidenced.

The career before Ford adds surprising range: end-of-life care policy, science policy, investigative journalism, documentary film, cultural preservation and radio production. She has worked across more institutional domains than almost anyone in her current field. Whether the cross-domain pattern is conscious strategy or accumulated instinct would be worth testing in conversation.
