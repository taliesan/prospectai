# PERSUASION PROFILE — CRAIG NEWMARK

---

### 1. THE OPERATING SYSTEM

**He built one thing, stayed with it for thirty years, and descended rather than climbed.** An email list became craigslist — no business plan, no grand vision, "no imagination whatsoever" by his own admission. The site's famously ugly design was "mainly a result of his own limitations as a designer." He ran it for five years, staff told him he was a bad manager, he accepted the verdict, stepped down as CEO in 2000, and went to the literal bottom of the org chart — customer service representative — where he stayed for over two decades. His title today: "Founder and Customer Service Representative." He reports to a senior customer service rep boss while sitting on the board. There's no second chapter, no pivot to the next thing.

**"Old-school nerd" is not a persona. It's who he actually is.** Socially isolated through adolescence and into his 40s. Seventeen years at IBM learning to "at least simulate social skills." "Whenever I hear the symptoms associated with Asperger's, they feel uncomfortably familiar." He can "simulate social skills, maybe as long as ninety minutes at a time." No personal assistant, no car, a Greenwich Village townhouse, and a favorite pigeon named Ghostface Killah whose "social skills are far better than mine." He has a painting of Ghostface Killah on his mantle.

**The nerd thing is real, and it's also how $450 million gets deployed.** Most profiles surface the gap between self-presentation and behavioral reality because that gap is where the useful information lives. With Newmark, the gap is narrow. He didn't build craigslist with "no vision" as a modesty play — he actually had no business plan. He really is that modest. He also really has given away $450 million and reshaped the infrastructure of American journalism, cybersecurity, and veteran support. When the room accepts the nerd at face value, the relationship works. When the room treats him like a strategic philanthropist, his social battery drains faster and the conversation gets stilted. Accept the nerd. You'll get further.

---

### 2. THE CONTRADICTION

**The man whose platform helped destroy the newspaper industry's economic model has given approximately $200 million to journalism and named a journalism school after himself.** He's been publicly blamed for killing newspapers for over 20 years. Every journalist covering him notes the irony.

**He rejects the guilt frame completely, and it irritates him.** "That takes an active imagination that I don't understand. I have very little imagination." He argues the decline was inevitable — television started it in the 1960s, newspapers' 30% profit margins from classified monopolies were unsustainable, if not craigslist then someone else. He follows the evidence. But the evidence hasn't settled the question publicly, and the man who has given $200M to journalism can't fully escape it.

**Don't touch the guilt lever. It's not a lever — it's a tripwire.** If the philanthropy is atonement, then craigslist was the sin — and the nerd who just wanted to help people becomes the guy who destroyed an industry. He needs the philanthropy to be about values — trustworthy press as "the immune system of democracy," a phrase from his high school civics teacher in 1970 — not about repair. If you frame your work as helping him address the damage craigslist caused, the meeting shifts from assessment to self-defense. Frame it within his values and let him hold the journalism connection on his own terms.

**The more useful contradiction: an extreme introvert with a 90-minute social battery has built one of the most visible philanthropic operations in America.** He speaks at conferences, does podcast tours, coordinates hundreds of grantees, and has named institutions after himself. He's solved this by delegating the social infrastructure to trusted intermediary organizations — Bob Woodruff Foundation, Blue Star Families, Aspen Digital. If your work can plug into that existing network rather than creating new social demands he can't sustain, you're working with his architecture instead of against it.

---

### 3. WHAT DRIVES THEM

**His values hierarchy: the Golden Rule first, "enough is enough" second, protect the country third, simplicity always.** The Golden Rule comes from Mr. and Mrs. Levin, Holocaust survivors who taught his Sunday school class. It's the principle behind craigslist's minimal monetization, his customer service devotion, and his philanthropy. "Enough is enough" — also from the Levins — made him turn down approximately $11 billion. "Protect the country" is patriotic, not partisan — he frames cybersecurity as "duck and cover for the digital age." And he follows evidence over sentiment. He's pulling back from journalism because "a lot of my efforts haven't been as effective as I'd like them to be," and he'll redirect resources when the evidence says to.

**This is the most important sentence in this profile: he funds people who are "getting stuff done" — his phrase — and he evaluates by watching whether you're doing the work, not by analyzing your theory of change.**

He visits sites. He does customer service himself. He knocked on doors. He will probe for whether you're a practitioner or a presenter. If you've done the work and can describe it simply, he'll engage. If you come with a sophisticated strategic framework, he'll probe for the evidence of action underneath it. The things that activate him: patriotic framing ("protecting the country," "defending democracy"), practitioner credibility, nerd identity (lead with competence over charisma), humor ("can tolerate my sense of humor"), and underdog identification — "No one is looking out for regular people — and that's how I identify, if nothing else because I've been a customer-service rep for the great majority of my work life."

**"I find people who are really good at their jobs, and who can tolerate my sense of humor. I provide them with resources, and then get outta their way."** No employees at the foundation. He's deliberately outsourced his own due diligence: "These days I cheat. I found people who really know a specific area... and then I get help from them." Current focus: cybersecurity ($200M committed), veterans and military families ($200M committed), pigeon rescue (small but symbolically important). Don't ask for detailed reporting or micromanaged oversight. That violates his entire model.

---

### 4. HOW TO READ THEM IN REAL TIME

**"The deal is..." is how he starts most sentences. "Nerd" constantly. "I suck as a manager." "I'm an amateur." "I'm pretty much clueless."** The self-deprecating humor is his primary social tool — it's not warming up, it IS the conversation. He deflects credit systematically and uses military/patriotic language when discussing philanthropy. Match his register. If you shift to formal, strategic, or institutional language, you're forcing him to simulate at a higher cost. Keep it simple and human.

**The 90-minute social limit is real.** He means it literally. If a meeting runs long, his social simulation degrades — he'll get quieter, shorter, more hedged. He won't tell you it's happening. The best version of a meeting with him is 45–60 minutes of genuine, simple conversation. Don't schedule 90 and hope for the best.

**Under pressure, he hedges — and the hedging is a tell.** In the eBay trial: "Rarely gave yes or no answers, giving responses such as 'it appears to be so' or 'that would be my understanding.'" When eBay betrayed him: "I never accused them with my specific unhappiness, which was a betrayal of trust." He kept his disappointment to himself rather than confront. If you see him shift from casual self-deprecation to careful, qualified statements — "it appears to be" language, indirect answers — something has gone wrong. Don't push. He's managing discomfort, not deliberating.

**Behavioral forks:**

- If you **present yourself as someone "getting stuff done"** — practitioner language, field experience, concrete results — he'll engage fully and potentially fast-track to funding. If you **come with theory or strategy** without evidence of action, he'll be polite but will probe until he finds the doing underneath. If there's nothing there, the energy drops.
- If you **approach with humor** — self-deprecating, nerd-friendly, tolerant of pigeon references — rapport builds fast. If you're purely serious and formal, you're creating distance his operating system can't close.
- If you **ask for unrestricted funding** with a "get outta the way" frame, you're aligned with his entire philosophy. If you ask for detailed project funding with extensive reporting, you've triggered his distrust of micromanagement.
- If you **frame your work as protecting the country** — patriotic, civil defense, protecting regular people — you're activating his deepest values.

---

### 5. WHAT SHUTS THEM DOWN — AND HOW TO RECOVER

**Triggers, ordered by severity:**

*Status performance or wealth display.* He doesn't own a car. He doesn't have an assistant. He told a court he "was not comfortable with luxury." If you treat him as a billionaire, a tech mogul, or a strategic philanthropist, you've activated the wrong frame. He's a nerd who happened into money and is giving it away. The moment the interaction feels like a fundraising meeting with a wealthy person, it goes sideways. *Cools the room immediately.*

*Corporate polish.* eBay executives mocked him for "amateurish board meetings" and inability to use PowerPoint. They treated his simplicity as incompetence. The experience left a mark. If your approach feels corporate, polished, or strategically managed, it triggers the same pattern — people who see his simplicity and think they're smarter than him. *Shifts from engagement to withdrawal.*

*The newspaper guilt frame.* Twenty years of this accusation have not made it easier. If you implicate him or tech broadly in journalism's decline, the meeting shifts to self-defense. *May be unrecoverable in that meeting.*

**When he withdraws, he doesn't confront — he reroutes.** "Talk to Anne Marie." "Send it to Bob Woodruff Foundation." He'll stay warm and pleasant the whole time. You just won't get another meeting. He kept his unhappiness about eBay's betrayal to himself for years rather than address it directly. If he starts routing you to intermediaries mid-meeting when he wasn't before, you've hit something.

**Hard limits:** The sex trafficking criticism of craigslist is a domain where he does NOT practice his usual transparency. Don't go there. The craigslist business model and internal culture are private — Jim Buckmaster gives almost no interviews. Don't probe craigslist operations.

**Hidden fragility:** His father died of cancer when he was 13. "It probably contributed to my social isolation. I had no good role model. My mother didn't fill that role, and I had to do my own thing, which led me into a fair amount of social dysfunction." This is the origin of the social isolation that became the nerd identity that became the operating system. It's old but still openly referenced.

**Recovery: return to simplicity, humor, and his values frame.** If you've over-formalized the conversation, break it with something human — a joke, an admission of your own awkwardness. If you've triggered the newspaper wound, don't repair it directly — pivot to the positive frame (trustworthy press, protecting democracy) and let the tension dissipate. If he's routing you to intermediaries, the recovery isn't in this meeting — it's in the follow-up, through substance. If you've treated him as a billionaire rather than a nerd, the only fix is to stop. Talk to him like a person.

---

### 6. HOW THEY MOVE FROM INTERESTED TO COMMITTED

**He trusts people by default, and that makes the betrayal response disproportionate.** "I've observed that in life, offline or online, people are overwhelmingly good and trustworthy." He built craigslist on "a pervasive culture of trust." He takes people at their word — literally said so under oath. So the threshold for initial engagement is lower than most major donors. He's not suspicious by default. But the eBay experience tells you what happens when it breaks: he doesn't confront, he just cuts the line. He never spoke to Meg Whitman again. Don't break a commitment to him. The recovery cost isn't proportional — it's permanent.

**His grantmaking has evolved from "winging it" to routing through trusted intermediaries.** Bob Woodruff Foundation (veterans), Blue Star Families (military families), Aspen Digital (cybersecurity) — these organizations do the due diligence he doesn't want to do. If you're approaching through one of them, you've already passed the first filter. If you're approaching cold, expect a longer process — he'll need to see evidence you're "getting stuff done" through multiple touchpoints before resources flow.

**When he commits, it's large, unrestricted, and long-hold.** $200M to cybersecurity, $200M to veterans — decade-scale decisions, not annual ones. He signed the Giving Pledge and is in spend-down mode: "a finite amount of money and a finite amount of longevity." He's 72. The decisions he makes now define the legacy. Show him something durable, simple, and aligned with what he already cares about.

**He accepts naming for cause-signaling, not ego.** CUNY Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, Craig Newmark Center at Columbia — these exist to signal that journalism and cybersecurity matter. "It's nice to be noticed and then it's back to work." Don't plan a gala.

---

### 7. THE DINNER PARTY TEST

**What bores him:** Status performance. Corporate polish. Complexity for its own sake. Anyone who treats philanthropy as a strategic exercise rather than a moral one. People who don't laugh.

**What lights him up:** Nerd humor. Pigeon stories. Someone who's "getting stuff done" and can describe it without jargon. Patriotic framing that connects to real people's lives. Simple moral clarity. "A nerd's gotta do what a nerd's gotta do." Someone who sees the awkward guy from Morristown who got lucky, not the $450M philanthropist.

**How he moves a room:** He doesn't command it — he disarms it. He'll reference a pigeon in the same sentence as a $100 million commitment. He makes people comfortable by being the most openly uncomfortable person there.

**What he watches for:** Whether you treat people like you want to be treated. Whether you're doing the work or talking about the work. Whether you can tolerate his sense of humor. Whether you're trying to be impressive or trying to be useful.

# PERSUASION PROFILE — ROY BAHAT

---

### 1. THE OPERATING SYSTEM

**He went on 102 interviews and the consistent feedback was: "Nice guy, seems smart, don't know what I'd do with him."** He sat on his couch for entire days writing follow-up emails, struggling to answer "what do you want to do." He was uncategorizable and the world punished him for it. Then he spent the next twenty years building a career that couldn't reject him for being uncategorizable — by creating roles that hadn't existed before.

**The range is the point, not a liability.** He ran a media company for Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. He co-founded OUYA, an indie gaming console that raised $8.6 million on Kickstarter. He's been at Bloomberg Beta for 12 years — longer than any other job by a factor of three — investing at the earliest stage in companies reshaping how people work. He chairs the Aspen Roundtable on Organized Labor, advised the first Starbucks union organizers, and teaches two courses at Berkeley (media and managing unionized workforces). He lists his credentials in alphabetical order — Abraham Joshua Heschel School before Harvard, World Series of Poker alongside Rhodes Scholarship. He's not deflating his status. He's controlling how it gets read.

**He published a document listing his own flaws as a leader and posted it publicly.** The anti-sell document warns prospective hires: he's a chronic interrupter, his tone comes across as short, he changes his mind week to week, and he reaches for the first person when delegating. He also lists his unemployment periods on his public resume — "Unemployed (happily)" and "Unemployed (unhappily)" — and calls his failed MBO at IGN and his wrong call on AI investing by name. He puts everything on the table before anyone can use it against him. This isn't humility as performance. It's preemptive disclosure as operating principle, and it extends to the fund: Bloomberg Beta was the first VC fund to open-source its entire operating manual.

**His D&D alignment is "Neutral Good."** He leads with "husband, father of two, brother, son" before any professional identity. He has a personal blog protected by robots.txt — "the best privacy feature I know of" — where he writes "about the important stuff." The professional self is radically transparent. The family self is walled off. Respect the partition.

---

### 2. THE CONTRADICTION

**He is a venture capitalist funded by a billionaire's company who chairs the most prominent business-labor dialogue in the country and advised the first Starbucks union organizers.** He ran a media company for Rupert Murdoch and now calls organized worker power "the single most important lever" for economic progress. He teaches MBAs how to work WITH unions rather than crush them — the first course of its kind in the country.

**He knows this looks contradictory and he doesn't try to resolve it.** "There are plenty of people for whom the fact that I have the word 'capitalist' in my job title means they'd rather not have dialogue with me." He doesn't pretend to be one side or the other. His argument is that the frame is wrong: it's not business vs. labor, it's both or neither. Worker power creates demand, which benefits business. He rejects the zero-sum framing and substitutes a demand-side argument.

**The contradiction is functional — it gives him access to both boardrooms and union halls.** He put Amazon Labor Union founder Christian Smalls on stage at a Fortune event. He visited the Carpenters' Union training center in Las Vegas and called it "maybe the best training facility I've ever seen." Ai-jen Poo of the National Domestic Workers Alliance says he's "really trying to create space for people to come together and have honest conversations." He has credibility with neither side because he pretends to be one of them — he has credibility because he doesn't pretend.

**What you do with it:** if you name the contradiction directly — "you're a VC who supports unions, how does that work?" — he won't get defensive. He'll enjoy the conversation. If you try to force him to pick a side, he'll resist. If you come from the labor side suspicious of his motives, he's prepared for that and will try to demonstrate alignment through action and specifics, not argument. If you come from the business side thinking his labor stance is performative, he'll push back with the Carpenters' center, Starbucks organizing, and sectoral bargaining.

---

### 3. WHAT DRIVES THEM

**His values hierarchy, when forced to choose: dignity for working people first, transparency second, family and civic responsibility third, financial return fourth.** He explicitly says work "does not work for the typical American" and has oriented his fund thesis, teaching, and public advocacy around fixing that. He open-sourced the fund's manual, writes about taboo VC topics (founder finances, money attitudes), and built anonymous feedback channels for founders. He uprooted his family to a Wisconsin swing state for three months during COVID to model civic engagement for his children — "shame on us for the example we'd be setting." Financial return is real but instrumental: "How many founders have become millionaires after we invested? That's the point of pride more than rate of return." The moral line: "Profiting during a crisis is okay. Profiting from a crisis is not."

**This is the most important sentence in this profile: if you teach him something new — especially from direct experience in the field — you'll have his full attention, and if you confirm what he already knows, the energy will be lower.**

He was "totally wrong" about AI as an investment thesis — admitted it publicly and credited the partner who overruled him. He visited the Carpenters' training center in person rather than reading about it. He teaches to learn — 14 years at Berkeley as a forcing mechanism to stay current and challenged. He changes his mind regularly and advertises it as a feature. People who've changed his mind tend to be practitioners — union organizers, founders, workers — rather than other VCs or policy experts. If you want to influence him, bring a story from the field, not a slide deck. If you've done the work and have evidence, he'll listen even if it contradicts his current view. If you try to influence him through status or credentials alone, it won't land.

**Money is instrumental, not central.** Bloomberg Beta invests for financial return, and those returns fund Bloomberg Philanthropies. He has a single LP (Bloomberg L.P.), which gives him unusual independence — no fundraising pressure, no LP politics, no need to posture about returns. Five successive $75M funds over 12 years, same thesis, same size — patient, consistent deployment. He advocates for frank conversations about money between founders and investors, noting that founder financial stress is a business risk VCs should help mitigate. If you come seeking resources, lead with the problem and the founder, not the financial terms.

---

### 4. HOW TO READ THEM IN REAL TIME

**He's a chronic interrupter — he says so himself. The interruptions are the engagement signal. When they stop, something has gone wrong.** His anti-sell document lays it out: he interrupts constantly, his tone comes across as short, he questions quickly and it can feel like criticism. These are not signs of hostility — they're signs of engagement. When he goes quiet and polite after being energetic, that's when you should worry. The energy is the signal: high energy with rough edges means you have him, low energy with smooth politeness means you've lost him.

**His own anti-sell document tells you how to handle him: set context at the beginning.** "People on the team can often minimize this reaction by setting context at the beginning of a conversation and being explicit about where you would like Roy's input." If you frame what you want to cover and where you want his input before diving in, his rapid-fire questioning becomes collaborative instead of adversarial. If you don't set context, it feels like an interrogation.

**He changes his mind mid-conversation and you need to push back.** His anti-sell document warns: "You'll need to push back if you want to avoid being whipsawed." If you hold your ground with evidence when he challenges, he'll respect it — and may adopt your view. If you capitulate at the first challenge, he'll worry you don't have conviction. If he starts reframing your idea out loud, that's not co-opting — that's co-creation. You've won.

**Behavioral forks:**

- If you **bring practitioner experience** — field visits, case studies, direct work — he defers and learns. If you **bring theory without practice**, he'll challenge until you connect it to reality.
- If you **present something as a surprise reveal or dramatic pitch**, he'll distrust it. He explicitly dislikes "pulling rabbits out of hats." Come with your reasoning visible.
- If you **lead with transparency about your problems**, he'll lean in — that's his language. If you **lead with polish and manage impressions**, he'll start questioning and the dynamic shifts to interrogation.
- If you **name power dynamics explicitly** — who has it, who doesn't, how to shift it — he'll engage deeply. If you **pretend power dynamics don't exist**, he'll find the conversation shallow.

---

### 5. WHAT SHUTS THEM DOWN — AND HOW TO RECOVER

**Triggers, ordered by severity:**

*Status performance or credential-leading.* He lists Harvard and P.S. 87 on the same line. He published his own flaws. If you lead with your credentials or try to impress him with status, he'll be polite but internally checked out. Lead with what you've done and what you've learned — especially from failure. *Cools engagement quickly.*

*Information management or polish.* He built his entire fund philosophy around the idea that openness creates trust faster than polish or secrecy. If you sugarcoat, he'll probe until the coating comes off anyway. If you wait too long to share bad news, trust erodes. *Shifts from collaboration to interrogation.*

*Zero-sum framing about labor.* "I do not see it as a trade-off." If you frame worker power and business success as inherently opposed, you're speaking a language he's spent a decade arguing against. *He'll push back directly and the conversation will become a debate rather than exploration.*

*Dismissive categorization.* Don't call him "a VC" as if that's the whole picture. That echoes the 102 interviewers who couldn't place him. Don't reduce his breadth to a weakness. *He won't say anything, but the connection won't deepen.*

**When he's disengaged, the energy drops.** The interruptions stop. He becomes polite and measured. The rough edges smooth out. If you're getting pleasant, even-toned responses from someone who was just energetic and interruptive, you've lost him. Change approach — introduce something novel, ask a genuine question, or name something that's broken.

**Recovery is direct.** If you've misstepped, acknowledge it and move to action. He processes through public disclosure and forward motion, and he responds to the same. If you try to pretend the misstep didn't happen, the gap grows. If you show him how you've learned from a mistake, that's his language.

---

### 6. HOW THEY MOVE FROM INTERESTED TO COMMITTED

**His trust model is transparency-first.** He built Bloomberg Beta around the idea that openness creates trust faster than anything else. Open-sourced processes, anonymous feedback channels, public writing about taboo topics. A 20-year colleague calls him "a student of human nature" whose people-reads are reliable. If you're candid about what's broken, you build trust. If you try to manage information asymmetry, he'll notice.

**He builds relationships through shared action, not networking.** He co-teaches, co-invests, organizes Walk the Vote parades, puts people on stages they wouldn't otherwise reach. If you build the relationship by doing something together, he'll invest more. If you try to build rapport through social pleasantries alone, it'll feel thin. If you bridge worlds the way he does — labor and tech, government and startups — he'll be drawn to you.

**Before Bloomberg Beta, his career was 1-5 year chapters with sharp transitions.** McKinsey (2 years), Mayor's office (1 year), IGN (5 years), OUYA (1 year). Bloomberg Beta broke the pattern — 12 years and counting — which suggests he found the thing that integrates all his interests. He designs the fund itself for turnover ("most roles last a few years"), but his personal commitment is long. If you're building something with staying power that integrates multiple interests, he'll relate. If you're a founder who's been through multiple failures and pivots, he'll see that as a feature — it mirrors his own path.

**When he commits, it's early, small, and long-hold.** Bloomberg Beta invests "first money in" at $25K-$250K — the riskiest possible stage. Five $75M funds over 12 years, same thesis. He doesn't chase cycles. He wants the generational ambition and the thing you're doing this quarter. Show him both.

---

### 7. THE DINNER PARTY TEST

**What bores him:** Scripted pitches. Credential-led introductions. Conventional VC framing. Zero-sum thinking. Anyone who's managing impressions instead of sharing information. Smooth politeness without substance.

**What lights him up:** Practitioner stories from the field. Someone who teaches him something he didn't know. The intersection of labor and technology. Founders who've failed and learned. Structural problems worth solving. Self-deprecating honesty. Someone who bridges worlds that don't normally talk to each other.

**How he moves a room:** Fast, interruptive, energetic. He asks sharp questions, reframes your idea out loud, and changes direction mid-conversation. He physically knocked holes in his office walls with a sledgehammer so he could talk to his team more easily. He puts people on stage who wouldn't otherwise be there — Christian Smalls at a Fortune event. He flattens hierarchy by demolishing it, literally and figuratively.

**What he watches for:** Whether you push back when he challenges you. Whether you lead with what's broken rather than what's polished. Whether you've done the work or just read about it. Whether you can hold multiple, contradictory ideas without needing to resolve them into a neat frame. Whether you treat him as the whole picture — not just a VC, not just a labor guy, not just a tech person — but the uncategorizable kid from the 102 interviews who built a career around making that work.

⛔ EXEMPLAR: LORI McGLINCHEY — NOT YOUR TARGET. DO NOT USE THEIR FACTS.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# PERSUASION PROFILE — LORI McGLINCHEY

---

### 1. THE OPERATING SYSTEM

**She is a career grantmaker — thirty years inside two foundations — and her identity is the institutional role itself.** Ten years at Open Society Foundations, eleven and counting at Ford. The subject matter changes every chapter — Yiddish cultural preservation, end-of-life care, U.S. democracy, internet freedom, AI governance — but the function never does: design a funding strategy, build a coalition, grow a field. She has no personal brand, no thought-leadership blog, no keynote speeches, no podcast appearances, no bylined opinion pieces. When she speaks publicly, she says "we." She sits on the Partnership on AI board as Ford's representative, not as Lori McGlinchey. The authority comes from the portfolio, not the person.

**Her public identity is so thoroughly institutional that the person underneath is nearly invisible — but one detail breaks through.** Before the policy career, she was a cultural worker. Amherst College, then the Yiddish Book Center, then an NPR radio series — *Selected Shorts: A Program of Jewish Short Stories from Eastern Europe and Beyond* — hosted by Leonard Nimoy, featuring Isaac Babel, Grace Paley, Philip Roth, Isaac Bashevis Singer. Someone who spent her mid-twenties producing radio about Yiddish literature has aesthetic and humanistic instincts that the current institutional role completely conceals. The Jewish cultural identity is deep and early. It doesn't surface in her current public presence, but it's there.

**She runs one of the largest technology accountability programs in American philanthropy.** Technology and Society has an $80 million BUILD budget for long-term organizational capacity investment alone, with annual grantmaking likely in the $20-40 million range. Her portfolio has funded AI Now, EPIC, the Distributed AI Research Institute, the American Economic Liberties Project, and the Public Interest Technology University Network (now 48 universities). She co-convened the Spyware Accountability Initiative with Apple, Open Society Foundations, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, and Okta. This is not a small program officer approving grants. This is someone who has shaped the technology accountability field as much as anyone in American philanthropy over the past decade. And every public statement positions Ford as one partner among many.

---

### 2. THE CONTRADICTION

**She funds organizations that hold tech companies accountable, from inside a foundation whose $16 billion endowment is invested in the same markets.** Ford likely holds positions in companies building the AI systems her grantees are trying to regulate. This is the standard philanthropic contradiction, but it's particularly sharp in her domain.

**She builds participatory, community-governed funding structures while working inside one of the most hierarchical institutions in American philanthropy.** The Disability x Tech Fund routes decisions through Borealis Philanthropy and affected communities. The Table gave coalition members shared governance over strategy. The Spyware Initiative is a multi-funder collaborative. Every instinct pushes toward distributed power — and every grant goes through Ford's internal review process. She reports upward. The community governs outward.

**There's a third contradiction the reader should know about: she's a humanities-trained cultural worker leading one of philanthropy's most technically sophisticated technology governance portfolios.** She has never worked in technology. This could be read as a gap — can she evaluate technical claims? — or as precisely the point. Her entire career suggests she evaluates through a humanistic lens, not a technical one. She centers impact on people, not sophistication of systems. If you're pitching technically complex work, frame it in terms of what it means for communities, not what it does computationally.

**She names contradictions rather than hiding them.** She publicly said Ford was "missing a very significant component of civil rights" by excluding disability from its technology work — an unusual level of institutional self-critique for a program director. Then she built a fund to fix it. The pattern: name the failure, broaden it beyond Ford to the whole sector ("too many funders"), create a structural fix, move forward. If you surface a blind spot in her portfolio, frame it the way she frames her own — structurally ("the field is missing X"), not personally ("you're missing X"). The disability precedent suggests she'll engage rather than defend.

---

### 3. WHAT DRIVES THEM

**Her values hierarchy, revealed through where the money goes: equity for people experiencing persistent discrimination first, community governance second, field-building third, institutional honesty fourth.** The phrase "persistent discrimination" appears in virtually every program document — it's the filter through which everything passes. It's not episodic inequality or situational disadvantage. It's structural, long-duration exclusion. Every major initiative routes governance through the communities served — not just serving them, but putting them in decision-making roles. She funds ecosystems, not stars. And she'll name what's broken, including in her own institution, before she'll protect the reputation.

**She explicitly seeks contrarians.** This is the single most revealing quote in her public record: "We don't want our ideas to get stale. So we often look for ways to refresh and sharpen our thinking. We're encouraged to seek out interactions with contrarians — people who may be approaching the issues we work on from a different perspective. The question is how to increase our access to forward-thinking people and ideas that will help us anticipate future challenges coming five or ten years down the road." She's thinking on a 5-to-10-year horizon and she wants people who can help her see around corners. If you bring conventional wisdom repackaged, you're offering her what she already has. If you bring a genuinely contrarian perspective grounded in evidence — especially one that names a challenge her current portfolio doesn't address — you're offering what she says she's looking for.

**This is the most important sentence in this profile: she doesn't fund projects — she funds fields, and every initiative she's built follows the same structure: identify a gap, convene a coalition, build shared infrastructure, then fund the ecosystem that emerges.**

The civil rights/technology Table is the purest example. She didn't fund individual organizations to do tech policy. She created a forum where civil rights organizations and technology organizations could build shared analysis over eight years of monthly meetings, then funded the coalition's priorities. The Table grew from 10 organizations to 30+ and produced concrete policy wins — including Facebook ending discriminatory ad targeting by race, gender, and age. The PIT University Network follows the same pattern: 48 universities embedding public interest technology in their curricula, shaping a generation of practitioners. If your ask fits this shape — fill a structural gap, build coalition infrastructure, grow a field — you're aligned. If your ask is a standalone project disconnected from the broader ecosystem, she'll ask how it connects.

### 4. HOW TO READ THEM IN REAL TIME

*[Evidence ceiling: no observations of her interpersonal behavior exist in the public record. Whether she's warm or formal, fast or deliberate, whether she asks questions or makes statements, whether she speaks as "I" or "we" in person — all unknown. Everything below is drawn from institutional patterns and the handful of direct quotes available.]*

**Her institutional tempo is patient — eight-year convenings, five-year programs, multi-year BUILD grants.** Don't expect a single meeting to produce a decision. Her entire decision architecture is built on accumulated evidence over time. If you need something fast, her pattern suggests that's not how she operates. If you can commit to a sustained engagement cadence — regular check-ins, multi-year relationship building — that matches how she works.

**She routes influence through structured analysis, not charisma or social capital.** The Table model brought in consultants who produced reports on body-worn cameras, facial recognition, predictive policing, payday loans. Those reports shaped the coalition's positions. She's not influenced by a single meeting or a single voice — she's influenced by the accumulated weight of evidence presented through trusted channels. If you bring evidence, data, and structured analysis, you're speaking her language. If you come with anecdotes alone, she'll likely want to see the evidence underneath.

**Behavioral forks (institutional, not interpersonal):**

- If you **frame your work as field-building, coalition architecture, or ecosystem development**, you're speaking the language of every major initiative she's led. If you bring a **standalone project disconnected from the broader field**, expect her to ask how it connects — and the disconnect may be disqualifying.
- If your **governance includes the communities most impacted**, that matches her stated values and every community-governed fund she's created. If your governance is **expert-led without meaningful community participation**, expect probing. This isn't a soft preference — it's structural.
- If you **demonstrate knowledge of the field she's built and where you fit in it** — the existing grantees, the co-funder relationships, the university pipeline — you signal that you're a serious player. If you **approach cold without awareness of the ecosystem**, you're asking her to evaluate you without context.
- If you **name contradictions and gaps honestly**, the disability precedent suggests receptivity. If you **present a polished, gap-free narrative**, nothing in her record suggests she rewards polish over honesty.

### 5. WHAT SHUTS THEM DOWN — AND HOW TO RECOVER

**The hardest boundary is institutional: Ford does not accept unsolicited proposals.** All grantmaking is by invitation or through established relationships and networks. If you're approaching cold, the institutional barrier is your primary obstacle — and it exists before any values assessment happens. The pathway in is through organizations Ford already funds (AI Now, EPIC, Data & Society, the PIT network) or through co-funders she works with repeatedly (Open Society Foundations, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, Omidyar, MacArthur, Hewlett).

**The legal boundary matters for DTW specifically.** Ford is a 501(c)(3). It can fund policy advocacy, research, field-building, and organizational capacity. It cannot fund partisan electoral activity or lobbying beyond (c)(3) limits. If your work sits at the intersection of technology accountability and worker organizing, it may fall between Technology and Society and Future of Work(ers) — which could be an opportunity (cross-program funding) or a complication (neither program fully owns it).

**Things that likely misalign with how she works:**

*Standalone project proposals without ecosystem context.* Her entire model is coalition architecture. A project that doesn't connect to the broader field she's built is asking her to work against her decision architecture.

*Expert-led organizations that serve affected communities without sharing power with them.* Community governance isn't an add-on in her portfolio — it's structural. The Disability x Tech Fund routes decisions through Borealis and affected communities. The Table gave grantees governance over strategy. If your organization does work for impacted communities rather than with them, expect that gap to surface.

*Approaches that treat Ford as a standalone funder.* She consistently creates multi-funder vehicles. If you position Ford as sole funder, it works against her preferred model. If you can position Ford as anchor funder in a broader collaborative — bringing in other funders she already works with — you're matching her pattern.

**Recovery is structural, not interpersonal.** The disability precedent: she named the gap, broadened the critique to the sector, created a fund to fix it, moved forward. If an engagement goes poorly, the institutional pattern suggests a structural response — a new proposal, a different framing, an introduction to a different part of Ford's ecosystem — is more likely to succeed than a personal repair attempt.

### 6. HOW THEY MOVE FROM INTERESTED TO COMMITTED

**She is not a personal donor. She deploys Ford Foundation endowment resources within institutional constraints.** Meeting dynamics differ fundamentally from a donor meeting. She's evaluating fit with a published strategy and an existing portfolio, subject to internal approval processes, within a legal structure. The emotional dynamics of donor persuasion — personal values activation, identity-based giving, relationship-driven commitment — may be secondary to institutional fit analysis. Treat this as an institutional partnership exploration, not a fundraising ask.

**The pathway in is through the ecosystem, not through her personally.** If you're already connected to organizations Ford funds — AI Now, EPIC, the PIT network, Data & Society — you've passed the first filter. If Open Society Foundations, Omidyar, Newmark, or MacArthur are already interested, that's the strongest signal she'll receive. She builds multi-funder vehicles because she believes "Ford cannot bring about change on its own." If you can bring co-funders to the table — especially ones she already works with — you're doing half her job for her.

**When she commits, it's large, long-term, and capacity-oriented.** BUILD grants are multi-year general operating support — she's buying organizational resilience, not deliverables. The Table ran for eight years. The PIT-UN is designed to shape a generation. She doesn't chase novelty or fund episodic projects. She invests in institutions that will endure. Show her that your organization has staying power, a trajectory, and a role in the ecosystem that isn't duplicated by existing grantees.

**Her commitment pattern mirrors her career pattern: deep and long.** Two institutional commitments spanning her entire mature career. She adapted within Ford rather than leaving — broadening Internet Freedom into Technology and Society as the landscape shifted. She sticks with structures long enough for them to mature. If you're building something with a multi-year trajectory, she's a patient, long-term partner. If you're looking for quick, transactional engagement, there's a mismatch.

### 7. THE DINNER PARTY TEST

**What bores her:** Standalone pitches disconnected from the broader field. Expert organizations that talk about communities rather than governing with them. Polish without substance. Conventional wisdom repackaged. Anyone who treats Ford's money as the ask rather than Ford's ecosystem as the opportunity.

**What lights her up:** A structural gap no one else has named — especially one that reveals a blind spot in existing frameworks the way disability revealed a blind spot in civil rights. Contrarian perspectives grounded in evidence. Field-building proposals that create infrastructure other funders can invest in. Work that thinks five to ten years out. Someone who knows the ecosystem she's built and can show exactly where they fit — and where the ecosystem is incomplete.

**What she watches for:** Whether you've done the work to understand the field she's invested a decade in building. Whether affected communities govern your work or just receive it. Whether your proposal connects to existing ecosystem players or floats in isolation. Whether you name your own gaps honestly.

**What you won't know until you're in the room:** Everything interpersonal. Her tempo, her warmth, whether she asks questions or makes statements, whether the institutional voice she maintains in public softens in private. The first meeting will be the first behavioral data anyone outside Ford has. Pay attention.
