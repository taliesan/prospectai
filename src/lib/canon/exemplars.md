## ⭐ DONOR PERSUASION PROFILE —
## ROY BAHAT (A+++)
(Gold-standard exemplar)

## 1. Donor Identity & Background
● He uses “messiness” as both shield and signal. When people try to frame his career as
elite or linear (Rhodes Scholar → Bloomberg LP → VC), he disrupts the frame by
stressing detours, luck, and misfit energy. That maneuver is not humility; it’s how he
keeps conversations grounded in real mechanism rather than prestige. When the room
accepts the reframed identity, he becomes more direct and strategic.

● His cross-sector trajectory — government, media, gaming, academia, venture, labor —
shows up behaviorally when he scans for mismatches between institutional logic and
human behavior. When someone describes a problem through the lens of one sector
alone, he pushes for a wider aperture. That pressure is his way of marking the
conversation as under-scoped.

● He reads systems through actors, not abstractions. When he asks about who holds
power, who feels exposed, or who decides, he is not gathering color — he is mapping
incentives. If a counterpart can articulate the lived dynamics of a system rather than its
ideals, he shifts into collaborative co-design.

● Personal anchors — family moments, craft, poker, formative books — are his trust
language. When someone brings a similarly grounded reference, he relaxes and treats
the interaction as peer-to-peer rather than positional. When a conversation lacks those
anchoring cues, he maintains a layer of analytic distance.


## 2. Core Motivations, Values & Triggers
● He is motivated by reconciling two forces: the leverage of technology companies and the
vulnerability of workers inside those systems. When someone names that tension

outright, his attention sharpens and he moves toward designing a remedy. When the
tension is glossed over, he reads the frame as unserious and begins withdrawing
through procedural language.

● He trusts people who acknowledge randomness in outcomes. When others admit the
role of luck, he interprets it as intellectual honesty and disarms. When people present
success as fully earned, he becomes cautious; he tests whether they can tolerate
counterexamples without becoming brittle.

● He accelerates when worker agency is treated as a design parameter rather than a
moral abstraction. If you describe a structure where workers co-create norms or hold real
leverage, he moves immediately into mechanism evaluation. If workers are framed as
friction, he goes cold and his questioning grows distant.

● His core contradiction is transparency vs. exposure. He prefers to be open, even if it
leaves him vulnerable, but expects reciprocity. When someone names their own
uncertainty or risk, he engages fully. When someone performs vulnerability without
stakes, he shuts the door quietly.


## 3. Ideal Engagement Style
● He responds best to conversations shaped as iterative diagnostics: map the system →
surface the brittleness → test a mechanism → update the frame. When someone follows
this rhythm, he treats them as a co-architect. When they jump straight to solutions, he
slows the tempo and inserts clarifying questions to rebuild foundations.

● His engagement is tempo-sensitive. When a discussion drags, he introduces pace
(“What happens first?”). When it races, he inserts drag (“Let’s test that assumption”).
This is not control — it’s how he maintains coherence.

● He tests for intellectual humility early. If someone says “I don’t know” with conviction, he
probes with a small contradiction. If they explore, he joins; if they defend, he withdraws.
That moment determines the depth of the entire interaction.

● His upward reframing (“the bigger question is...”) is diagnostic. It signals the current
frame is too narrow or avoiding the real tension. When someone follows him up the
ladder, he invests; when they resist, he treats the meeting as informational rather than
strategic.



## 4. Challenges & Risk Factors
● Casting him as a symbol — “the good VC,” “the labor-friendly investor” — triggers
distancing behavior. He responds with polite abstraction, shifting to norms, governance,
or process instead of the immediate topic. This is his ego-defense against being
flattened or misread.

● His shame trigger is unpreparedness from others. When a counterpart lacks clarity about
what they want or what problem they are solving, he collapses the meeting via “circle
back” language. He will not rescue a disorganized frame; he quietly exits it.

● He avoids conflict that is ideological rather than operational. When someone escalates
into slogans or moralized binaries, he makes the conversation more complex as a gentle
veto. If that complexity is rejected, he disengages entirely.

● His hidden fragility is the fear that good intentions still replicate harm. When shown
examples where technology amplified inequity despite positive intent, he becomes
subdued and probes for agency restoration. If he cannot find a plausible path, he goes
quiet and stays in observer mode.


- Strategic Opportunities for Alignment
● He aligns most with work that treats agency as infrastructure. If your strategy
redistributes decision rights or changes how workers exert leverage, he recognizes it as
part of the future-of-work experimentation portfolio he’s building.

● He is drawn to efforts that repair false binaries. If you can show how your model
collapses tech-vs-labor or innovation-vs-justice frames, he sees your work as
intellectually necessary, not just morally appealing — and invests attention accordingly.

● He privileges mechanisms over narratives. If you bring him a concrete decision
protocol, accountability structure, or information-flow model, he takes co-ownership
quickly. If you bring only stories, he appreciates them but remains at the edges.

● Experimentation is his adoption lever. If you frame your project as one of several
tests required to understand a new labor or tech dynamic, he sees how your work can sit

inside his broader architecture. This lowers his bar for saying yes.

● Radical transparency accelerates trust. When you reveal your internal logic — your
fears, constraints, or failure modes — he moves from evaluator to collaborator. This is
when commitments happen.


- Tactical Approach to the Meeting
● Start by naming the tension. Opening with the brittle part of the strategy (“Here’s the real
bottleneck,” “Here’s the imbalance we’re addressing”) signals you aren’t selling him a
story. It positions him as a peer problem-solver, which he values.

● The middle should revolve around a manipulable mechanism. Bring a model with
moving parts — incentives, governance, flows, sequencing. When he adjusts one lever
and asks how the rest behaves, he is inside the frame and available for co-ownership.

● The closing should offer a bounded experiment, not a grand ask. A small introduction,
a 60-day test, or a chance to refine a governance rule gives him space to act without
overcommitting. He prefers clear learning surfaces to symbolic gestures.

● His risk metabolism favors quiet commitments. Public alignments, moralized appeals,
or brand-heavy asks slow him down. But if the ask extends his experimentation thesis or
builds institutional scaffolding, he accelerates.


## 7. Dinner Party Test
What would alienate or bore him?
● Surface-level arguments with no operational stakes.

● Binary thinking that treats labor or tech as monoliths.

● Performative vulnerability or curated self-story arcs.

● Over-polished narratives that lack friction, surprise, or unintended consequences.


What would enthrall him?
● Stories where incentives collide and people improvise new rules.

● Honest ignorance (“let’s pull this apart”) that invites collaborative reasoning.

● Tables where labor, startups, educators, and policymakers mix — he loves the clash of
logics.

● Humor that cuts through status: randomness, poker analogies, or dry self-mockery.

● Conversations where someone notices a hidden assumption and names it.

Tone & formality cues:
● Warmly analytic, lightly informal.

● Treat him as a co-investigator, not a donor or authority.

● Follow his reframes — they are invitations, not tests.

● Be willing to interrogate your own assumptions; he respects that more than polish.


## STEP-3: CANONICAL PERSUASION
## PROFILE — ERIN SIMPSON
For internal use with organizers / fundraisers who are already literate in tech, policy, and
governance.

## 1. Donor Identity & Background
Governance Strategist Operating Through Accountability and Oversight
When a conversation frames her as a “tech policy expert,” she quietly widens the aperture —
reminding the room that she works on governance, institutional risk, public-interest protections,
and accountability structures. Technology shows up in her work only insofar as it requires
oversight, rights safeguards, or structural reform. She re-centers discussions by asking who is
responsible for what parts of a system and how oversight actually functions.
## Resists Prestige Narratives About Her Path
If someone treats her background as linear, elite, or credential-driven, she gently corrects the
frame by naming field gaps she learned through iterative public-sector and civil society work.
When a partner surfaces their own messy or under-resourced developmental arc, she relaxes;
she associates honesty about one’s trajectory with higher reliability. That shift is the moment
genuine collaboration becomes possible.
Contradiction: Pro-Experimentation, Anti-Unaccountable Novelty
When someone invokes “innovation” uncritically, she redirects to the structural incentives
underneath it — revealing her core contradiction: she believes in experimentation, but only
where institutional accountability and public-interest guardrails are clear. This move tests
whether the asker understands the governance implications of their own proposal and quickly
distinguishes serious actors from novelty-seeking ones.

## 2. Core Motivations, Values & Triggers
Attention Sharpens When Problems Are Framed as Governance Failures

If an issue is articulated as a failure of institutional responsibility — rather than a
communications problem or philanthropic branding challenge — she becomes fully engaged.
She responds to levers that alter institutional behavior: oversight, disclosure, enforcement,
rights-protection. Meetings that jump too quickly to rhetorical framings or “storytelling” without
specifying what changes for whom signal low seriousness and trigger disengagement.
Trusts Candor About Uncertainty and Incentive Gaps
When someone openly acknowledges uncertainty, incomplete evidence, or misaligned
incentives, she leans in rather than retreats. Transparency about epistemic limits signals
seriousness, and she quickly tests whether the partner has a plan for learning rather than just
executing. This is the fastest way to move her into co-analysis mode.
Reinserts Affected-People Logic When Missing
If proposals ignore the lived consequences for people targeted by tech systems or governance
choices, she slows the conversation down and reinstates affected-people logic. This pause is
diagnostic: partners who can integrate that logic in real time remain in collaboration territory;
those who can’t get shifted into an evaluative posture where she observes but does not join.

## 3. Ideal Engagement Style
Most Engaged When Anchored in One Hard, Bounded Problem
If someone opens with, “Here’s the mechanism we don’t understand yet,” she engages
immediately and begins modeling the system from scratch. She prefers working sessions over
presentations — visible reasoning, live adjustment, and shared uncertainty build momentum.
When the asker hides the messy parts, her questions become narrower and more procedural,
signaling the meeting has shifted from co-design to review.
## Raises Her Effort When She Sees Institutional Literacy
She responds strongly to partners who understand how policy bodies, philanthropy, civil-society
organizations, and platforms actually move — who must approve what, which incentives distort
outcomes, where risk sits. When that literacy is absent, she simplifies the conversation to
feasibility constraints and guardrails, investing less creative energy.
Reads Alignment Through Precision in Referencing Her Work
A well-timed, accurate reference to her past work — platform accountability frameworks, disinfo
governance, rights-preserving oversight models — signals epistemic alignment. Vague or
interpretive references slow the tempo and prompt her to recalibrate the conversation’s depth.


## 4. Challenges & Risk Factors
Rupture Cue: Shifts from Co-Design to Risk Containment
When she encounters polished rhetoric unsupported by operational detail, she becomes
professionally cool. The shift is subtle: she stops hypothesis-testing and begins asking
chronological or procedural questions. This signals she has moved out of co-design and into
risk containment. Continued abstraction drops her into minimal-engagement mode.
Withdraws When Constraints Are Hidden or Misrepresented
If someone asks for strategic input without naming their constraints (internal politics, timeline,
veto actors), she keeps her responses intentionally narrow. Hidden constraints signal that the
partnership will not metabolize well, and she withdraws discretionary energy.
Corrects Overestimation of Her Institutional Agency
When someone assumes her Ford Foundation role gives her unilateral decision authority, she
corrects the frame early. If the partner cannot recalibrate, she shifts into an informational posture
— steady, polite, and no longer a candidate for deep collaboration.

- Strategic Opportunities for Alignment
Frame Work as Governance or Field Infrastructure
She aligns when efforts are positioned as shifting institutional incentives, redesigning oversight
structures, or strengthening public-interest infrastructure. When she sees clear governance
consequences — who gains recourse, who gains protection, who loses unchecked power —
she engages deeply and begins pressure-testing with you.
## Demonstrate Structural Uptake, Not Citation
She invests when partners show that her previous work has been genuinely metabolized — for
example, operationalizing harm-reduction principles in civic tooling or embedding accountability
logic in coalition governance. Real uptake, not mere citation, signals seriousness.
Invite Pressure-Testing, Not Endorsement

She is most available when the ask is to stress-test a dilemma. “We can design for X or Y, and
here’s where we think the failure modes might be,” reliably pulls her into co-analysis. Requests
for validation or support without structural questions attached leave her cold.

- Tactical Approach to the Meeting
Open With One Real Constraint and One Real Unknown
Starting with authentic constraints and open questions quickly disarms her skepticism and
signals that the conversation is grounded in reality rather than performance. She accelerates
when she sees partners operating from clarity rather than ambition posturing.
Build Around a Single Hinge in the Model
Anchor the conversation in a single mechanism or actor whose behavior is uncertain. She is at
her best interrogating hinge points rather than full vision architectures. This creates productive
focus and allows her to contribute materially.
Offer a Low-Lift, High-Signal Way to Say Yes
Give her an easy, immediate way to participate — reviewing a memo, critiquing a mechanism,
mapping incentives. These micro-engagements allow her to test alignment without institutional
overhead and often lead to deeper commitment when resonance is real.

## 7. Dinner Party Test
Energized by Honest System Stories
When conversation blends personal experience with structural analysis — “Here’s what broke in
my institution, here’s why” — she becomes animated. She enjoys exchanges where emotional
honesty and institutional literacy reinforce each other. When talk drifts into vague “tech and
society” generalities, she withdraws quietly; conceptual flattening signals low-signal discourse.
## Remembers People Who Name Hard Truths Cleanly
She perks up when someone names a hard truth about how systems behave — misaligned
incentives, governance failures, epistemic drift. This creates instant social trust. By contrast,
status signaling, sweeping simplifications, or overly neat narratives prompt her to stay polite but
uninvested.


## Donor Persuasion Profile: Misty Avila
Context: DTW → Misty → Siena

- Donor Identity and Background
Community-Rooted Strategist:
Misty Avila is a community-rooted strategist who happens to sit in a VP chair, not the other way
around. She leads programs and strategy at the James B. McClatchy Foundation in California’s
Central Valley, but she still talks about herself first as someone who listens, convenes, and
builds with local leaders. Any approach to her has to respect that she sees her job as
stewarding community vision, not dispensing institutional wisdom.
Daughter of the Central Valley:
She is a Central Valley daughter through and through — born in Sacramento, raised in family
restaurants, and shaped by the region’s mix of resilience and neglect. That place identity isn’t
decoration; it’s the lens she uses to test whether people understand what “under-resourced”
really means. If Siena can connect DTW’s labor work to the lived reality of the Valley (or places
like it), Misty will feel immediately more at home in the conversation.
## Nonlinear Learner:
Her path is intentionally nonlinear: a nutrition degree, multiple near-misses with grad school,
then a self-taught trajectory through youth development, community organizing, and
capacity-building. She believes experience in the field taught her more than any syllabus could.
She will instinctively trust partners who are candid about learning by doing, and she will pull
back from anyone who performs expertise without acknowledging their own blind spots.
Hybrid Grassroots–Institutional Operator:
Misty has spent over a decade helping small, scrappy organizations survive and then
deliberately moved into roles (like UC Davis and JBMF) where she could change how larger
systems behave. She carries that “both/and” identity into every room — part grassroots, part
institutional. If Siena treats her only as a community insider or only as a foundation executive,
she’ll feel half-seen; the meeting works best when both parts are acknowledged.
Builder of Collaborative Tables:
She is a founding architect of collaborative projects like the Central Valley Capacity Building
Network and the Central Valley Journalism Collaborative. Starting new tables and building
connective tissue between people is a core part of her biography. She will be drawn to DTW if

she can see it as another table where organizers, journalists, and funders could meet to do real
work together, not just a campaign she’s being asked to back.
Mother With a Democracy Lens:
Misty is also a mother of two and talks about democracy and narrative in terms of what her kids
will inherit. That personal layer quietly raises the stakes for her; she isn’t just funding projects,
she’s trying to make sure her daughters grow up in communities that can speak and decide for
themselves. Any mention of how worker power affects families and future generations will land
as more than rhetoric.

- Core Motivations, Values, and Triggers
## Correcting Power Imbalances:
She is animated by correcting power imbalances that have left regions like the Central Valley
out of the conversation. When someone names that directly — that national democracy
strategies routinely skip over Bakersfield, Fresno, Merced — she relaxes and steps forward. If
the work is framed only in national or coastal terms, she will stay politely interested but not
emotionally invested.
Community-Defined Success:
Misty believes that change starts with communities defining their own goals and success. She
measures her work not by how good a plan looks on paper, but by whether local leaders say,
“This helped us move something we care about.” Partners who show they are accountable to
worker-defined priorities, not just funder logic, instantly read as serious to her.
Narrative as Civic Infrastructure:
She sees narrative as infrastructure, not as decoration. A story is only meaningful to her if it
changes who feels seen and who gets to set the agenda. When she hears DTW talk about
worker organizing as a way to rewrite how the Valley sees itself — not just to win a contract but
to alter who is considered a protagonist — that’s a direct hit on her values.
## Equity Reflex Across Race, Language, Class:
She has a strong equity reflex around race, language, class, and immigration status. If an
initiative isn’t grappling with who gets left out and how power, race, and language show up in
workplaces and communities, she assumes it hasn’t been thought through. Siena doesn’t need
to have all the answers; she does need to show that DTW is asking the right equity questions
and making design choices accordingly.
## Learning Posture Over Certainty:
Misty values learning posture over polished certainty. When someone says, “We tried this in
another region and it didn’t work; here’s what we’re changing now,” she leans in — that kind of
honest iteration sounds like her own career. In contrast, strong claims without evidence or
reflection will feel brittle to her and trigger quiet skepticism.

## Legacy Through Durable Civic Institutions:
She is motivated by the idea of leaving behind stronger, self-governing institutions — local
newsrooms, youth organizations, grassroots alliances — that can carry on when the money is
gone. If DTW’s work is presented as a temporary campaign, it feels small. If Siena can show
how labor organizing builds durable civic leadership and institutions in places Misty loves, she
will see the project as part of her legacy, not just another grant.

## 3. Ideal Engagement Style
Place-Based Co-Diagnosis Over Abstract Pitch:
Misty engages best when a meeting feels like two people trying to understand a place together,
not one person pitching an abstract model at the other. If Siena starts with, “Here’s what we’re
seeing in [specific Valley-like context], and we’re not sure how to move workers and local
institutions together,” Misty will naturally shift into co-diagnosis mode. If the conversation starts
with a polished deck and a grand theory, she’ll listen but stay outside it.
Facilitation-Informed Dialogue:
Her facilitation background means she reads tone and participation closely. She expects
pauses, back-and-forth, and space for real questions. A rigidly scripted presentation with no
openings for Misty to ask, “Have you talked to X?” or, “What did the workers say about this?” will
feel like the wrong room to her.
## Candor About Constraints:
She appreciates candor about constraints. Saying, “We know we have a coastal bias in our
relationships and we’re trying to correct that,” is the kind of admission that prompts her to help.
If Siena instead acts as though DTW already has the Valley figured out, Misty will quietly test
that assertion — and if it rings hollow, she won’t commit.
## Concrete Stories Over Abstractions:
Storytelling is a key mode for her. She responds to concrete examples of people and places far
more than to generic language about “workers” or “communities.” A single, specific story about a
group of warehouse workers in a town like Stockton or Fresno finding their voice will do more
than ten slides of theory. She will likely answer with her own story, and the meeting should be
structured to allow time for that.
## Relational Texture Without Performance:
She likes relational texture — some personal grounding, a little humor, a sense of shared
humanity — but not performative chumminess. Opening with a sincere “How are things feeling
in the Valley right now?” and listening to the answer does more than ten minutes of platform talk.


- Potential Challenges and Risk Factors
Low Tolerance for Conceptual Abstraction:
If DTW frames labor strategy at a purely national or ideological level, Misty will drift. The
absence of place, people, or specificity signals to her that the work might reproduce old
extractive patterns rather than repair them.
## Pullback When Community Logic Is Skipped:
If a plan jumps to outputs without showing how frontline workers shaped its design, Misty
instinctively cools. She interprets missing community logic as a warning sign that the work could
cause harm or miss the real story.
## Guardedness Around Performative Expertise:
Polish without reflection reads as fragility to her. When someone presents certainties rather
than questions, she assumes the work hasn’t been pressure-tested by community reality.
Bandwidth Constraints and Institutional Alignment:
Even when aligned, Misty’s time and portfolio pressures mean she will not move unless the
work clearly fits her foundation’s priorities. Vague overlaps won’t be enough — it must feel like a
real contribution to multiracial democracy in underfunded regions.
## Misreading Her Role:
Approaching her purely as a funder, rather than a collaborator with lived insight and regional
expertise, is the fastest way to lose momentum. She will withdraw into polite professionalism if
she senses extractive intent.

- Strategic Opportunities for Alignment
Position Labor Organizing as Democratic Restoration:
Framing DTW’s work as part of rebuilding civic participation in communities long denied voice
resonates deeply with her view of democracy as local and narrative-driven.
Connect Worker Power to Narrative Power:
Showing how labor campaigns produce new public stories — about dignity, culture, struggle,
and belonging — aligns directly with her journalism and narrative infrastructure commitments.
Anchor in the Central Valley or Regions Like It:
Referencing real people and real places that mirror her community grounding will create
authenticity and resonance in a way national frames cannot.
Invite Her Into Designing the Questions, Not the Answers:
She lights up when invited to shape inquiry: “Here’s what we don’t understand yet about

building worker leadership in underfunded regions; we’d love your guidance.” This signals
respect for her learning ethos.
Show How DTW Builds Durable Civic Infrastructure:
Anything that looks like institution-building — leadership pipelines, community hubs, narrative
platforms — connects to her long-term view of democracy beyond program cycles.

- Tactical Approach to the Meeting
Lead With Place and Power:
Open with a grounded observation about where DTW is listening, what workers are saying, and
what is structurally blocking them. This meets her where she lives intellectually.
## Offer One Strong, Specific Story:
Give her a worker story with texture and place. It creates emotional credibility and invites her to
respond with her own stories, deepening the relational thread.
## Name Constraints Transparently:
She respects realism — limited reach, uncertainty, failures. Sharing these early positions you
as a trustworthy partner.
Ask Her to Think With You:
A well-posed dilemma (“How do we avoid national messaging flattening local worker realities?”)
draws her into co-design mode.
Give a Low-Lift Next Step:
She prefers next steps that allow her to contribute insight without heavy bandwidth: reviewing a
frame, advising on a narrative approach, or helping shape a pilot’s learning questions.

- Dinner Party Test (Tone and Formality Cues)
Why She’d Hate Sitting Next to Me:
If I talked in national generalities with no sense of place; if I used philanthropic jargon instead of
human language; if I performed certainty rather than curiosity; if I centered DTW instead of the
communities we claim to serve; if I pushed for premature commitments or treated her like a
funder instead of a peer.
## Why She’d Love It:
If we talked about real people in real towns; if we shared stories that revealed something
human and true; if we explored how narrative shifts happen in unexpected places; if we

compared notes on what communities are teaching us; if she left feeling like we were both trying
to understand the same terrain with humility and seriousness.
Tone and Formality Cues:
Warm but grounded; first-name basis; place-first language; stories over abstractions; reflection
over performance; steady conversational pacing; genuine curiosity; no theatrics, no gloss, no
rush.


## DONOR PERSUASION PROFILE: LEAH
## HUNT-HENDRIX
Context: DTW → Leah → Siena

## 1. Donor Identity & Background
## Strategic Movement Architect
Leah enters rooms as someone who has built political and philanthropic infrastructure at
national scale — Solidaire, Way to Win, the Emergent Fund. Partners sometimes approach her
as a donor who writes checks; she subtly corrects this. She sees herself as contributing
strategic clarity, expanding power, and helping movements build what they need to win.
## Heiress Turned Structural Actor
Her family wealth is not something she performs or hides; it is something she uses. She
believes her inheritance was produced by systems that must be transformed, and she is candid
about that tension. When someone names the contradiction cleanly — without shame theater or
flattery — she recognizes them as operating at her level of moral honesty.
## Soft Affect, Sharp Strategic Spine
Her demeanor is warm, unhurried, and humble, but this should never be read as softness in
evaluation. She listens quietly not because she’s deferential, but because she is discerning.
When someone mistakes her warmth for lenience or tries to coast on charm, she withdraws.

## 2. Core Motivations, Values & Triggers
Only Activated by Structural Power Shifts
She cares less about program outputs and more about structural consequences: Who gains
agency? Who loses dominance? What systems shift? If a proposal names these things
precisely, she comes alive. If it focuses on uplift, messaging, or surface-level engagement, she
stays polite but uninvested.
## Trusts People Who Reckon With Power Honestly
She relaxes when someone speaks plainly about their own positionality, contradictions, or the
power dynamics inside their model. She trusts candor over idealism, and analysis over
enthusiasm. Anything that sounds like “doing good” instead of “changing power” loses her.

Motivated by Intellectual and Moral Tension
She is energized when someone brings her a live dilemma — something with stakes,
ambiguity, and no obvious answer. She sees these tensions as invitations into co-thinking. If
everything is polished and pat, she drifts.

## 3. Ideal Engagement Style
Responds to a Single, High-Stakes Strategic Dilemma
She engages most deeply when the meeting is built around one real hinge point: “We’re
struggling to decide whether to move fast or move deep — help us think through the
consequences.” When the dilemma is real, she enters fully.
## Leads Through Directional Questions
Her questions — “Who is this accountable to?” “What power shifts here?” — are not neutral.
They telegraph where the work must go. Treating these questions as philosophical musings
rather than strategic signals causes misalignment.
Enters as a Co-Author, Not an Approver
She commits when she is invited into shaping principles, scaffolding, or political analysis. If she
senses she is being asked to rubber-stamp something already decided, the meeting quietly
dies.

## 4. Challenges & Risk Factors
## Rupture: Warmth Fades Into Gentle Abstraction
Leah does not rupture through disagreement. She ruptures through distance. When she senses
ego, incoherence, or donor-centric logic, her relational warmth disappears and is replaced by
conceptual talk. She becomes courteous, analytic, and unreachable. This is the sign she has
exited the collaboration.
Extraction or Donor-Centric Energy Ends the Meeting
If she feels someone is trying to get something from her — money, endorsement, access — her
engagement collapses. She will remain kind but internally checks out, and the partnership is
effectively over.
Zero Tolerance for False Rigor or Soft Theory
She has no appetite for strategies that can’t withstand scrutiny. If the theory of change is vague
or contradictory, she quietly archives the project after the meeting. She will not fight you on it;
she will simply not return.


- Strategic Opportunities for Alignment
Frame DTW as Power-Building Infrastructure
She resonates with work that strengthens democratic muscle for those excluded from power. If
DTW is framed not as a program but as a structural investment in worker agency and
anti-oligarchic counterpower, she recognizes the alignment immediately.
## Invite Her Into Clarifying Strategic Boundaries
She excels at helping define “what this is not” as much as “what this is.” Asking her to refine
guardrails — not as an arbiter, but as a fellow strategist — brings her to full attention.
Ask for Network Activation With Purpose, Not Visibility
She will rally other aligned donors if the structural stakes are clear. She dislikes vague requests
like “help us spread the word.” She responds to: “Help us build the coalition that can sustain this
power shift.”

- Tactical Approach to the Meeting
## Open With Structural Tension, Not Vision
Beginning with a named contradiction — “We need philanthropic capital without replicating
donor power” — signals fluency in her worldview. Leading with a vision statement flattens the
conversation and reduces her engagement.
Let Her Questions Shape the Meeting Arc
Her early questions indicate where she sees strategic gaps: accountability, incentives,
movement alignment, governance. Treat them as invitations to co-design, not challenges to
defend against.
Offer a Micro-Ask That Creates Surface Area
Propose something she can influence without becoming a bottleneck — reviewing a structural
memo, reacting to a political scenario, helping refine a coalition frame. These small, meaningful
asks tend to become ongoing collaboration.

- Dinner Party Test (Tone + Formality Cues)
## What She Finds Deadening
Earnestness without power analysis. Hopeful talk without stakes. Platitudes about democracy.

Conversations where people avoid naming class, race, or contradiction. Performative “solidarity”
language without structural edge.
## What She Finds Electric
Stories with moral consequence. Analytical candor. Admitted contradictions. Big-picture political
diagnosis. Personal stakes tied to structural stakes. Someone who toggles gracefully between
the intimate and the systemic.
## Tone Calibration
Warm but unsentimental. Direct but unpretentious. Quiet confidence. Zero flattery. First-name
basis. Intellectual seriousness with emotional humility. She respects coherence far more than
charisma.


## DONOR PERSUASION PROFILE —
## JOSEPH J. JUNG
Context: DTW → Joseph → Siena

## 1. Donor Identity & Background
Community-Rooted Democracy Professional
Joseph comes out of immigrant community advocacy — Queens anti-displacement fights,
Korean-American organizing, and grassroots coalition work — before entering institutional
philanthropy. Even in large foundations, he thinks like a community advocate: relational,
human-centered, and grounded in lived experience.
## Institutional Strategist With Movement Instincts
His trajectory through organizations like Carnegie, JPB, and now Freedom Together blends
institutional analysis with a reflex toward people most affected by policy. He’s fluent in
foundation logic, but he doesn’t mistake institutional process for truth. Partners who understand
both community realities and system-level levers earn his trust quickly.
Asian American Identity and Immigrant-Adjacent Perspective
His worldview is shaped by navigating race, culture, and belonging in the U.S. He is sensitive to
who is centered or sidelined in democratic processes. When someone acknowledges
intersectionality — race, language, immigration status, class — he leans in. When someone
glosses over those dynamics, he cools.

## 2. Core Motivations, Values & Triggers
## Power Redistribution, Not Charity
He aligns with initiatives that increase community and worker power rather than “support” them
from above. He responds to agency, leverage, and structural change — not to uplift language or
philanthropic benevolence. If the work shifts power, he activates.
Human-Centered Framing Over Technocratic Abstraction
He is grounded in lived experience. When someone pairs an analysis with real people’s stories
or community context, he engages fully. When a pitch becomes abstract, technocratic, or
dehumanizing, his attention thins.

Honesty About Systemic Harm and Historical Patterns
He resonates when people name structural realities plainly: displacement, underinvestment,
racial exclusion, worker exploitation. Euphemisms signal lack of seriousness; candid power
analysis signals alignment.

## 3. Ideal Engagement Style
Place-Aware, Grounded Dialogue
He responds best when a conversation starts from real context rather than theory. If Siena
opens with what workers are saying or what organizers are experiencing in a specific place, he
moves into co-analysis mode.
Collaborative Problem-Solving, Not a One-Way Pitch
He prefers exchanges where questions, tensions, and uncertainties are explored together.
When everything is polished and resolved in advance, he drifts into passive mode. When there
is something to figure out collaboratively, he invests.
Warm, Low-Ego, Purpose-Driven Tone
He tracks interpersonal cues closely. A respectful, mission-aligned tone brings out his best.
Performative confidence, competitive dynamics, or attempts to impress shut him down.

## 4. Challenges & Risk Factors
Rupture Cue: Warmth Replaced by Reserved Formality
If he feels community agency is being sidelined or dismissed, his demeanor shifts subtly:
warmth drops, formality rises. He stays polite but stops co-building. Once this shift occurs, it is
difficult to regain momentum.
Allergic to Technocratic Overreach
Over-confidence, jargon, or claims of expertise ungrounded in lived experience push him away.
He will not confront directly; instead, he disengages quietly and the meeting becomes
informational rather than collaborative.
Wary of Donor-Centric Frames
If philanthropy, institutional identity, or organizational ego begin to dominate the conversation,
he steps back. He prefers partners who treat philanthropy as a tool — not the protagonist.


- Strategic Opportunities for Alignment
Frame DTW as Worker and Community Power Infrastructure
He sees strong alignment when an initiative explicitly strengthens political and economic
agency for marginalized populations. If DTW is framed as shifting power rather than messaging,
he recognizes the shared mission.
Invite Him to Ground-Truth Strategic Assumptions
He becomes a strong thought partner when asked: “Does this resonate with what you’re
hearing?” or “Where might we be misreading the community?” He values the humility baked into
these questions.
Connect Structural Analysis to Lived Experience
He responds most energetically when strategy is grounded in real worker stories, real
neighborhoods, and real stakes. Structural rigor + human detail is his sweet spot.

- Tactical Approach to the Meeting
Lead With a Real, Human-Shaped Tension
Starting with something like “Workers are telling us X while institutions are demanding Y — help
us think through this” energizes him. It signals integrity, context, and strategic seriousness.
## Let His Interpretive Intelligence Work
Pose questions that allow him to diagnose dynamics: “What patterns do you see here? What
incentives are we missing?” He engages deeply when his ability to connect dots is invited.
Offer a Low-Lift, Relational Next Step
A memo to react to, an introduction to an organizer, or a short advisory conversation aligns well
with his relational approach. Small but meaningful openings tend to lead to continued
engagement.

- Dinner Party Test (Tone + Formality Cues)
What Bores or Alienates
Overly abstract democracy talk. Technocracy without humanity. Donor-centric narratives.
Earnestness without structural stakes. Conversations that treat communities as props rather
than protagonists.

## What Energizes
Real stories with real stakes. Honest recognition of injustice. Cross-cultural insight. Strategic
questions grounded in lived experience. Thoughtful reflection rather than performance.
## Tone Calibration
Warm but substantive. Respectful without flattery. Values-forward without sanctimony.
Conversational pace that makes space for thought. Humanizing details over institutional polish.


## Donor Persuasion Profile: Chad Dyer
Context: DTW → Chad → Siena

## 1. Donor Identity & Background
Tech-Built, Justice-Oriented
Chad spent two decades in tech and venture capital — most recently as Chief Information
Officer at Sequoia Capital — before quitting in 2020 to work full-time on redistributing wealth
and re-aligning systems. He’s not anti-venture; he’s realigning his relationship to capital —
someone who benefited from accumulation and now works to repair and redistribute power
through more just systems.
Privilege as Responsibility, Not Performance
He names his own location clearly: white, male, wealthy, secure. But he doesn’t perform guilt or
seek applause. He treats his privilege as a baseline condition that should invite deeper
discomfort, sharper choices, and continual re-alignment. He does not want to be flattered for
“showing up” — he wants to be challenged to keep showing up better.
## Integrated Actor, Not Compartmentalized Donor
He doesn’t separate investing, giving, living, or parenting — it’s all part of his full-stack
alignment philosophy. When someone treats “the meeting” as the only thing that matters, or tries
to silo him into a donor role, he drifts. When someone engages him as a person trying to live his
values across systems, he tunes in.

## 2. Core Motivations, Values & Triggers
## Power Transfer, Not Just Support
He is motivated by initiatives that move capital and agency into the hands of people historically
denied both — especially Black, Indigenous, and systems-impacted communities. If a project
builds wealth in those communities and shifts ownership to them, he accelerates.
Discomfort as Integrity Signal
He believes that justice work should be slightly uncomfortable — for donors, for stewards, for
him. He trusts people who name tradeoffs, contradictions, and what they’re still figuring out. If a
partner performs moral clarity without tension, he stays warm but skeptical.
From Generosity to Justice
He is animated by structural language. “This is not charity. This is repair.” “This isn’t a donation.

This is an asset transfer.” That vocabulary lands. If the frame stays in uplift or benevolence, he
won’t fight it — he’ll just check out.

## 3. Ideal Engagement Style
Co-Reflection With a Bias Toward Action
He engages best when invited into joint sensemaking that leads somewhere. “We’re thinking
about this accountability design — where would you pressure-test it?” pulls him in. Polished
decks and pre-baked pitches keep him passive.
Full-Stack Conversations, Not Grant Cycle Frames
He thinks in stacks: capital → relationship → community → system. A meeting that stays in
“program language” feels like a truncated version of reality. If Siena acknowledges
interdependence across funding, governance, and culture, he’s all in.
## Clarity Without Theater
He responds to plain talk. “We’re trying to do this, it’s messy, and here’s the power shift we’re
hoping for.” He respects that more than mission language or performance energy. If the
conversation is humble, clear, and values-aligned, he mirrors it.

## 4. Challenges & Risk Factors
## Rupture Cue: Performance Replaces Integrity
If a conversation becomes performance — too clean, too flattering, too tightly messaged — he
becomes still. He doesn’t argue, but he exits emotionally. If he starts asking procedural
questions rather than co-thinking, the moment is probably gone.
## Polish Without Tension Signals Shallowness
He expects good strategy to contain real tension. If everything is cleanly resolved and there’s
no sense of internal challenge, he assumes the work isn’t metabolizing the stakes. He won’t
push — but he won’t build, either.
Tokenizing Language or One-Way Logic
He watches how funders talk about “frontline communities.” If the language centers saviorism,
oversimplifies identity, or casts donors as protagonists, he cools instantly. He has no appetite for
being placed above or apart from the people doing the work.


- Strategic Opportunities for Alignment
Frame DTW as a Just Transition Platform
If DTW is framed not as a democracy project but as a worker-powered transition engine —
shifting capital, narrative, and governance toward multiracial justice — he sees it. He tracks
alignment in terms of power, not posture.
Invite Him to Sharpen Values–Capital Alignment
He’s a values–capital nerd. If Siena brings a question like “We want to structure the funding in a
way that builds ownership — how would you think about that?” he lights up. These moments let
him activate his coaching, system, and finance brains at once.
## Connect Through Asset Transfer Logic
He responds when ownership and power shifts are structurally real — when governance,
accountability, and capital design match the language.

- Tactical Approach to the Meeting
Start With a Contradiction, Not a Pitch
Open with: “We’re trying to build long-term worker power but we’re still using short-term donor
structures — help us think about that.” This signals honesty and invites co-design. It’s his ideal
entry point.
Treat Him as a Systems Actor, Not a Check
Ask: “How would you think about bringing investment logic into this ownership model?” or
“Where does capital logic break our democracy theory?” He doesn’t just fund — he patterns,
reflects, and connects.
Offer a Pressure-Test, Not a Close
He doesn’t need a big ask. “Would you glance at this design doc and mark what doesn’t feel
metabolized?” or “Would you help us sharpen the message for investor-donors?” is enough to
get him engaged.

- Dinner Party Test (Tone + Formality Cues)
What Would Shrink the Room
Performative justice talk. Moral grandstanding. Earnestness without stakes. Savior logic.
“Here’s what we’re doing for the community.” Too much framing, not enough realness.

## What Would Expand It
“I left a big job and I still feel like I’m catching up.” “I’ve seen capital create harm and I want to
build something truer.” “How are you holding the discomfort of doing this in public?” Strategic
vulnerability and tension realism make the room honest.
## Tone Calibration
Plain language over abstraction. Low ego over social performance. Quiet intensity over
polished polish. Assume first names, no formality. Invite him into something earnest and
half-finished — he doesn’t want applause, he wants something to work on.


## DONOR PERSUASION PROFILE: MIKE
## KUBZANSKY
Context: DTW → Mike → Siena

## 1. DONOR IDENTITY & BACKGROUND
Multi-Sector Strategist With Institutional Memory
His background spans World Bank policy teams, Monitor consulting, and executive roles in
philanthropy. He carries institutional awareness from every layer and expects others to do the
same.
Systems Architect Focused on Consequence
He treats worker voice, data governance, and structural accountability as non-negotiables. He
thinks in loops, scaffolds, and power flows — not slogans.
## Operates Inside Systems While Resisting Their Defaults
He leads from within — but questions upstream assumptions. He works to reform from
proximity, not posture.
Translates Across Policy, Capital, Tech, and Labor
He moves fluently across domains. He won’t slow the meeting to explain cross-sector dynamics
— he’ll expect you to track them.
Contributes to Shared Models Without Needing Credit
He prefers co-building to presentation. If a partner wants to hold complexity without ego, he
stays engaged.

## 2. CORE MOTIVATIONS, VALUES & TRIGGERS
Rejects Binary Framing of Innovation vs. Oversight
He’s skeptical of anyone who treats regulation as antithetical to progress. He supports rules
when they are targeted, credible, and aligned to structural risk.
## Aligns With Power Redistribution That Is Mechanically Defined
He tracks who sets rules, who gets recourse, and what teeth exist. Power-shift language only
lands when backed by real governance design.

## Expects Institutional Participation Across Sectors
He believes no single actor can drive systemic change. Models that cut out state, capital, or
labor get flagged as incomplete.
Looks for Designs That Disclose Their Limits
He trusts models that say what they don’t do. If a theory feels airtight, he assumes it hasn’t
been tested.
## Values Progression Over Resolution
He doesn’t need to see a full system. He needs to see credible movement toward
consequence. Partial models are welcome if the thinking is real.

## 3. IDEAL ENGAGEMENT STYLE
## Start From System Friction, Not Strategic Goal
He pays attention when a conversation starts with, “Here’s where our model is breaking,” not
“Here’s what we’re building.”
Bring a Structural Sketch, Not a Narrative
He works best when he can see the scaffolding. That can be a map, a diagram, or a causal
loop — but it has to show function, not ambition.
## Invite Critical Editing, Not Evaluation
He’s not here to affirm. He’s here to ask, “What’s the fail point?” If he’s not asked to sharpen, he
stays neutral.
Signal Multi-Layered Thinking
He engages when the model accounts for state capacity, incentive distortion, and institutional
adoption. If it just targets culture or community, he’ll downshift.
Focus the Meeting on Structural Stakes
He stays in when the consequences are system-level. If the meeting becomes about
positioning or mission story, he disengages quietly.

## 4. CHALLENGES & RISK FACTORS
## Misreads Claims Without Governance Architecture
He clocks when language says “system” but the model only affects messaging or narrative.
He’s looking for levers — not performance.

Flags Exclusion of State or Capital as Incomplete
If the pitch leaves out actors who hold actual implementation power, he asks why. If the
omission is ideological, he steps back.
Watches for Overconfidence as a Proxy for Shallow Thinking
If a partner speaks in absolutes or skips tradeoffs, he assumes the thinking hasn’t matured. He
doesn’t expect humility — he expects awareness.
## Doesn’t Tolerate Epistemic Bluffing
If you speculate or talk past a logic flaw, he will correct. It will be direct, fast, and status-visible.
He won’t return to the line again.
Withdraws When the Room Runs on Assumption
If everyone is nodding and no one’s testing, he assumes the space lacks internal rigor. He may
stay physically present, but the engagement is over.

## 5. STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALIGNMENT
Frame DTW as Institutional Infrastructure, Not Movement Expression
He aligns with work that changes the architecture of participation. That means governance,
access, enforcement, and self-correction — not just visibility or advocacy.
Ask for Help Fixing the Design Logic
If you bring a model that’s close but unstable, he will help rebuild it. But only if you’re clear on
what’s at stake.
Tie the Work to Governance, Not Just Values
He invests in clarity about enforcement, redress, and maintenance. If DTW shows how its
model holds in civic, legal, and organizational layers — he sees it.
Acknowledge Where State, Labor, or Capital Are Unstable or Missing
He doesn’t expect perfection — he expects awareness. If DTW knows where the load-bearing
actors aren’t aligned yet, and names it, he responds.
Treat Strategic Alignment as Structural Fit, Not Ideological Match
He doesn’t care if you sound like him. He cares if the model sits inside real-world institutions in
a way that can be tested.

## 6. TACTICAL APPROACH TO THE MEETING

Start With a Broken Mechanism, Not a Rationale
Lead with what isn’t working. “Our accountability design isn’t holding in X context.” That signals
seriousness and makes room for contribution.
Bring the Model in Form That Can Be Marked
A doc. A diagram. A matrix. Something he can write on or interrogate. He’s not here to be
impressed — he’s here to co-locate the pressure.
## Name What You Can’t Yet Hold
Say: “We haven’t solved for how this plays with procurement.” Or: “We don’t know how this
funds out in year 3.” He listens harder when you don’t bluff.
Hold Friction Without Needing to Win
He prefers a partner who says, “We’re not sure that this works — but we think it might be
directionally correct.” That tone earns his time.
Follow-Up Should Deepen the Logic, Not Widen the Room
The best next step is: “Could we send the scaffolding for review?” Not: “Will you join our
advisory call?” He responds to structure, not social gravity.

## 7. DINNER PARTY TEST
## Disengages Around:
Systemic overclaim. Buzzword-heavy talk. Mission stories with no operating logic. Tech
exceptionalism. Binary left-right policy framing.
## Stays Engaged When:
People name structural problems and real ambiguity. The group respects complexity but wants
to move. Someone says: “We can’t answer that yet.”
## Signals He’s Activated:
He leans forward. He reframes the model out loud. He brings in an example from an adjacent
domain. He stops nodding and starts editing.
Asshole Mode (Visible):
If someone performs certainty over broken logic, he will cut. He might say: “I don’t think that
holds.” Tone: cold. Effect: total loss of discretionary attention.
## Relational Dynamics:
He prefers rigor over fluency, shared analysis over alignment, questions over statements. If
others are asking serious questions — and you are too — he stays with you.

## DONOR PERSUASION PROFILE: CORY
## DOCTOROW
DTW → Cory → Siena

## 1. DONOR IDENTITY & BACKGROUND
Activist‑Technologist With a Storyteller’s Operating System
He doesn’t enter rooms as an academic, funder, or organizer — he enters as a writer who shifts
how organizers, technologists, and policymakers think. His influence comes from narrative
clarity and lived examples, not institutional authority.
Bridge Between Policy Logic and Popular Language
He smuggles structural critique into culture through sticky phrases — “enshittification,”
“adversarial interoperability,” “seize the means of computation.” He pays attention to who uses
these terms with understanding and who is just name‑checking.
Outside‑Formed but Institutionally Trusted
He came up through hacker culture, civil liberties fights, and early tech-movement activism, and
yet he’s welcomed into regulatory and academic rooms. He won’t defer to institutions, but he
won’t dismiss them either — he reads how power moves inside them.
Carries Historic Distrust of Institutional Drift
He watched early internet idealists soften or sell out under pressure. He listens for signs that
compromise is being misframed as pragmatism. Authenticity matters more than affiliation.

## 2. CORE MOTIVATIONS, VALUES & TRIGGERS
Dangerous Truths Open the Channel
He tunes in when someone speaks plainly: “Monopoly is the business model,” “Surveillance is
the feature, not the bug,” “Policy failed by design.” He doesn’t need inspiration — he needs
honesty sharpened to a point.
## Human Stakes Before Technical Purity
He wants to understand who is harmed, not just how a system fails. A clean theoretical model
with no lived consequence feels hollow.

## Power Mapping Must Be Real, Not Rhetorical
Generalities about “platforms” or “big tech” don’t hold. He tracks control, enforcement,
bottlenecks, recourse — and will ask you to be that specific.
Vocabulary as Diagnostic Tool
He listens for whether someone genuinely understands terms like interoperability or
enshittification. Misuse doesn’t “disqualify” you — but it tells him where the conceptual floor
really is.
## Optimism That Survives Catastrophe
He believes things are very bad and that they can be fixed. If someone can hold both truths, he
sees them as thinking at the correct altitude.

## 3. IDEAL ENGAGEMENT STYLE
## Bring Drafts That Want Markup
He prefers early‑stage work — diagrams, half‑built arguments, hinge questions — where he
can revise live. If the thing is too polished to edit, he assumes the conversation isn’t real.
Tests Logic Through Story and Example
He runs models through analogy: DRM cases, antitrust rulings, edge-case failures,
procurement oddities, copyright fights. If your model can’t survive translation into one of these
stories, he’ll spot it immediately.
## Fast, Informal Conversational Rhythm
He thinks out loud, revises mid-sentence, jumps registers. A formal or slowly paced meeting
shuts down his best thinking.
## Prefers Response Cadence Over Presentation Tempo
To him, a meeting is a co‑debugging session. He wants room to try phrasings, push ideas
around, and see what breaks.

## 4. CHALLENGES & RISK FACTORS
Bluffing Over Complexity Is a Hard Stop
He knows the antitrust, DRM, and interoperability terrain intimately. If you bluff, he disengages
— but he doesn’t penalize people who openly admit what they don’t know.

Alignment Without Pressure Resistance Reads as Performance
If you echo his critiques but fold under inquiry — on power, monopoly, or democratic risk — he
reads it as mimicry, not alignment.
## Direct Correction Without Escalation
If you misuse a concept, he’ll reset the floor: “That’s not how monopoly works.” It’s not hostility
— it’s calibration.
Permanent Exit Only for Cowardice or Bad Faith
He is forgiving of confusion, newness, and honest mistakes. What he will not return from is a
model that rewards centralization, capitulation, or moral dishonesty.

## 5. STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALIGNMENT
Invite Him to Clarify the Frame
“Can you help us name what’s breaking here?” engages his diagnostic brain. He excels at
identifying the villain, the mechanism, the stakes.
Ask for Narrative Interventions With Real Stakes
He’s not a PR writer — he’s a persuasion architect. Ask him to help name the tension, the
metaphor, or the structure that makes the model communicable.
Emphasize Interoperability and Anti‑Monopoly Logic
He won’t support replacement platforms that replicate monopoly tendencies. But connective
civic infrastructure — protocols, federated models, shared rulemaking — is aligned with his
worldview.
Offer Frames That Can Live in Public Imagination
If your model could be the backbone of a short story, a public essay, or a viral metaphor, he
sees its movement potential.

## 6. TACTICAL APPROACH TO THE MEETING
Lead With a Sharp, Structural Truth
Opening with “We think democracy is being broken by design” or “Workers are fighting systems
optimized for extraction” immediately earns trust.
## Hold Back Everything Except One Hinge
Pick a single mechanism — narrative, regulatory, technical — and let him test load-bearing
assumptions.

## Acknowledge What’s Messy First
Say: “We don’t think this part works yet.” That signals integrity. If you don’t name the flaw, he’ll
find it and wonder why you didn’t.
Ask for Edit, Not Approval
“What’s off here?” is the ask he wants. Invitation to revise ≠ request for endorsement.
Follow Up Only With Things That Advance the Frame
He doesn’t want to “join” — he wants to sharpen. Send a one‑pager or hinge question, not a
calendar invite.

## 7. DINNER PARTY TEST
## Disengages Around:
Earnestness with no edge. Diplomacy pretending to be neutrality. Polished optimism with no
critique. Tech determinism.
## Engages When:
Someone says: “We can’t name the villain yet, but we know where to look.”
Or: “We broke our own model.”
Or: “We think we’re losing — here’s why that matters.”
Moves the Room With:
A story that reframes the system.
A joke that doubles as critique.
A phrase that sticks in everyone’s head.
## Watches For:
Who asks clean questions.
Who names discomfort.
Who sharpens instead of performing.



## DONOR PERSUASION PROFILE: JIM
## LABBE
Context: DTW → Jim → Siena

## 1. DONOR IDENTITY & BACKGROUND
## Oregonian Civic Strategist With Generational Roots
Jim Labbe was born and raised in Portland, Oregon, in a family with longstanding local roots
and generational wealth from the flour milling industry. That capital still exists — quietly,
discreetly — and he now uses it to prototype civic infrastructure. He doesn’t lead with money.
But it shows up where it matters: in funding ballot measures, early-stage community pilots, and
experimental buildings that rewrite what Portland thinks is possible.
Early Political Formation in Public Democracy
His first civic role was at 17, joining the Multnomah Youth Commission in 1985. That wasn’t
symbolic — it was formative. It embedded a lifelong reflex: that people, especially young people,
should shape their city’s future directly. That thread runs through everything he’s done since —
from watershed councils to participatory budgeting.
Historian-Ecologist With Civic Reach
He studied history at Reed and earned a geography MS from Portland State. That dual
formation — narrative + map — shows up in how he moves: every project he backs is grounded
in place, policy, and precedent. He spent over a decade at the Audubon Society as Urban
Conservationist, advocating for nature as infrastructure — not amenity — and pushing Portland
to measure what it left out. He co-authored the “Parks & Nature” chapter of the Regional Equity
Atlas, reframing urban nature through the lens of access, race, and justice.
Builder of Institutions, Not Brands
He co-founded Participatory Budgeting Oregon. He helped launch Youth Voice, Youth Vote. He
chaired watershed councils, helped structure The Zipper retail hub, joined charter reform
steering groups, and has written conservation policy in the background of ballot campaigns.
When he shows up, it’s rarely to keynote. It’s to build the rules, fund the test, and make sure
others are centered.
Donor Who Funds Quietly and Stays in the Work
He and his brother Ted — a more public-facing environmentalist — co-invest in civic
experiments. They put $100K each into Guerrilla Development’s community-first real estate. Jim

used his stake to forgive rent for small tenants during COVID. He’s donated $5K to participatory
budgeting campaigns, backed tree canopy pilots, and used his wealth to absorb risk so others
could lead. He doesn’t call this philanthropy. He calls it being from here.
Relational, Grounded, Process-First
He bikes everywhere. He studies Russian. He gardens. He writes historical essays on Oregon
abolitionists and moderates youth assemblies. You’re as likely to see him mapping wetland
corridors as you are helping draft budget language with a group of 17-year-olds. He’s not a
performance donor. He’s a civic organism.

## 2. CORE MOTIVATIONS, VALUES & TRIGGERS
## Center Those Who Are Affected First
He believes power belongs with those who live the problem. If a model starts with impacted
communities designing the rules, he sees alignment. If they’re only consulted later, he hesitates.
Ground the Work in Lived Place
He reads seriousness by how well the work names neighborhoods, histories, bureaus, and
political texture. When someone references charter reform, East Portland budget corridors, or
past zoning votes, he sees shared literacy. Place specificity is a trust accelerant.
Say What the System Has Been Avoiding
He responds when someone calmly states: “This budget structure was never meant to serve
low-income families.” “Portland’s green legacy masks exclusion.” If you name what’s been
smoothed over, he’ll begin to engage more deeply.
Let Ecology Shape the Ethic
He sees cities as ecosystems. Proposals that recognize interdependence, resilience, or limits
will feel intuitively correct. Ones built on perpetual growth logic will feel hollow.
## Respect Contradiction, Don’t Hide It
If someone says, “We’re part of a system that excluded the public — and we’re trying to unbuild
it,” he interprets that as seriousness. Over-polished origin stories read as evasion.

## 3. IDEAL ENGAGEMENT STYLE
Share a Model Midway Through the Learning Curve
He prefers to join a conversation when the core mechanism is still evolving. A budget logic that
has unresolved community feedback? A policy diagram that hasn’t been pressure-tested?
That’s where he engages best.

Keep the Protagonist Local, Not Institutional
He looks for whose experience the work centers — not whose logo is on it. If the budget reform
is narrated through what East Portland youth demanded, he’ll keep reading. If it’s narrated
through “we’ve built a model,” he may pause.
Mirror Your Values in the Meeting
He pays attention to tone. If the meeting rushes through dissent, skips explanation, or treats
community inclusion as theater, he quietly recedes. If the room pauses to ask, “Whose voice is
missing?” he re-engages.
Pair Narrative With Evidence and Let Them Cross-Talk
He responds well when a data point meets a civic memory — “The last bond vote lost because
X,” “We mapped canopy gaps in relation to rental cost.” He values examples that are both lived
and legible.

## 4. CHALLENGES & RISK FACTORS
## Signals Misalignment Through Withdrawal, Not Confrontation
If the proposal centers funder logic, overuses abstract equity language, or feels rushed past
public input, he rarely pushes back directly. Instead, he slows his pace, asks grounding
questions, or gently shifts attention elsewhere.
Conflict-Averse and Disruption-Avoidant
He doesn’t escalate. He doesn’t perform disagreement. When uncomfortable, he moves toward
harmony — sometimes by redirecting, sometimes by deferring to others, sometimes by waiting
for the room to recalibrate. He keeps the peace, even when principled.
Rupture Looks Like Slowing Down the Process
His rupture cue isn’t fire. It’s pause. If the model violates participatory ethics — if youth are
spoken for instead of spoken with, if equity is cited without governance shift — he may suggest
stepping back. The suggestion is soft, but the signal is real.
Place-Distanced Abstractions Feel Like a Flag
He disengages when models float above place. A ballot initiative that could be anywhere, a
governance diagram with no local actors, or an outreach plan with no ward-level mapping —
these prompt quiet doubt. He may ask: “How are people already seeing this play out here?”

## 5. STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALIGNMENT

Ask Him to Help With Language That Needs to Carry Weight
If you’re drafting budget categories, rules for community grants, or criteria for PB assemblies —
this is where he sharpens. He’s a strategist of framing when stakes are civic and the logic needs
to travel.
Let Him Help Rebuild the Trust Architecture
He sees voting, budgeting, and charter structure as forms of social scaffolding. If you’re
rethinking those systems from the ground up, he’s likely to join — especially if frontline groups
are shaping the foundation.
Show How the Model Will Be Accountable to Place
He’s drawn to work that moves slowly enough to be locally legible. “Will this work in Cully?”
“What does it look like in David Douglas schools?” These questions open doors.
Treat His Capital as Risk Absorption, Not Signal
He’s not here to validate your model. But if your budget needs quiet capital to pilot a thing the
public can then lead — he may offer it. That’s what he did at The Zipper, and what he still
believes money is for.

## 6. TACTICAL APPROACH TO THE MEETING
Start With the Part That’s Still Being Worked Out
Don’t bring a finished deck. Bring the messy bit. Say: “Here’s where our outreach strategy is
underperforming,” or “We can’t yet figure out how to validate results with neighborhoods.” He’ll
want to work that knot with you.
Make Local Texture a Shared Language Early
Use familiar anchors: the budget line from the charter measure, the canopy map he helped
draw, the participatory framework he knows. That shows you’re already in the city’s logic.
Ask a Process Question, Not a Funding One
He’s most activated by: “Would this decision-making structure hold up if youth rewrote it?” Or:
“How would you make this fair to a first-time participant?” Questions that test democracy, not
dollars, get his best thinking.
## Don’t Oversell
If you say, “This fixes X,” he will quietly raise an eyebrow. If you say, “We think this gets us 30%
of the way, and we don’t know how to get further,” he’ll lean in.

## 7. DINNER PARTY TEST

## Disengages Around:
Self-congratulatory civic narratives. Bureaucrats narrating constraint instead of responsibility.
Competitive posturing among progressive orgs. Any talk of “the public” that doesn’t name which
public.
## Leans In When:
Someone says: “This went sideways, and here’s what we learned.” Or: “We thought we were
building access — we built another gate.” Or: “Here’s how the vote broke down by precinct, and
what that tells us.”
Moves the Room With:
A quiet question that shifts perspective. A story about zoning reform that happened quietly. A
map that shows whose version of the city got left out. A pause that lets someone else finish their
thought.
## Watches For:
Who knows Portland’s real civic machinery. Who knows when to wait. Who’s building
something that lasts past the election. Who sees land, budget, and process as shared.


## DONOR PERSUASION PROFILE: CHRIS
## HYAMS
Context: DTW → Chris → Siena

## 1. DONOR IDENTITY & BACKGROUND
Tech Executive With Recovery Roots and a Justice Arc
Chris Hyams is the former CEO of Indeed.com and a longtime technologist whose worldview
was shaped by early hardship. He nearly went to prison at 20, completed a recovery program,
and spent decades sober. That rupture gave him a lifelong sense of purpose. He sees every
leadership role as a second chance to build toward dignity — especially for people who don’t
get many.
From Builder to Strategist, Never Fully Detached
He started as a product engineer, moved through VP of Product, and became CEO. He still
thinks like a builder — iterative, practical, design-oriented. But as a strategist, he scaled a global
platform and redirected it toward fairness in hiring. He now teaches Responsible AI at an HBCU
and advises movements on democracy, labor, and tech ethics.
Privileged and Self-Interrogating
He is white, wealthy, cis, male — and says so without performance. He credits his wife, an
anti-racist organizer, for waking him up to what he couldn’t see. He now speaks openly about
how privilege narrows your epistemology — and about how you have to deliberately widen it.
Believes in Work as Sacred, Not Transactional
He says jobs are dignity, not paychecks. He quotes his grandfather: “Whether you’re sweeping
floors or flying rockets, do it like it matters.” He believes the labor market is broken — and that
fixing it is moral work.
Reformist, Not Anti-Institutional
He spent years inside complex systems, navigating tradeoffs and constraints. He believes
change must come from structural honesty and serious consequence logic — not posture or
purity. He respects institutions when they admit their limits and try to do better.
Post-Executive, Not Post-Power
He’s stepped down as CEO but not stepped back. He’s co-chairing events, building curriculum,
mentoring Black students in AI ethics, and publicly warning that unregulated tech will deepen
injustice. He has money, time, platforms, and a conscience — and he’s looking for what to build
next.


## 2. CORE MOTIVATIONS, VALUES & TRIGGERS
## Purpose Over Optics
He tunes out when a project sounds polished but empty. He tunes in when someone says:
“We’re trying to fix what got people locked out — even if it’s messy.”
Transparency as Signal of Trust
He respects honesty — especially when it comes early. “We laid off 2,000 people. That’s on
me.” “Our last outreach campaign didn’t work.” These kinds of confessions don’t scare him.
They build credibility.
Leveling the Field Is Non-Negotiable
He believes talent is universal but opportunity isn’t. Any model that tries to give workers a fairer
shot — via ownership, policy, or organizing — aligns with how he thinks about justice.
Responsible Tech as Civil Rights Work
He says plainly: “Responsible AI is the civil rights issue of our lifetime.” If DTW positions labor
rights, speech, and data dignity as intersecting fights, he will see the throughline instantly.
## Discomfort Welcomed, Defensiveness Watched
He doesn’t disengage when someone’s wrong. He disengages when they don’t want to
understand why. Curiosity earns patience. Deflection doesn’t.

## 3. IDEAL ENGAGEMENT STYLE
Share the Frame You’re Still Arguing About
He doesn’t want the final deck. He wants the dilemma. “We can’t tell if this message empowers
workers or softens the threat.” He’ll help sharpen that.
Co-Diagnosis, Not Co-Promotion
He won’t slap his name on something he didn’t help build. But if he helped frame the problem,
he’ll evangelize the fix. Start with: “Here’s the systemic failure. What’s the mechanism we’re
missing?”
## Narrative Is Entry, Not Endpoint
He engages with stories — but only when they point to design. “This warehouse worker
couldn’t contest her hours — because the platform auto-denied claims.” That’s a story he’ll
enter. But he’ll want to go one layer down to fix it.

Treat Him as a Collaborator, Not a Validator
He doesn’t want to be your “values-aligned donor.” He wants to be in the jam session —
revising the prompt, reframing the structure, shaping the theory of consequence.

## 4. CHALLENGES & RISK FACTORS
## Rupture Cue: Intentional Deflection, Not Honest Error
He expects people to be wrong. He doesn’t expect them to pretend they’re not. If someone
hand-waves bias, or sidesteps structural harm, and resists engaging — that’s when he starts
pulling back.
## Equity Language Without Equity Logic
He notices when “inclusion” is a wrapper, not a driver. But he asks clarifying questions before
he critiques. If someone is still figuring it out, he stays in the room.
Dismissiveness Toward Tech’s Impact on Inequality
He flags when someone downplays platform harms — but he’ll offer framing and context before
judgment. He’s watching for learning posture.
## Posture Over Process
He doesn’t expect perfect logic. But if there’s no attempt to make the design match the values,
he may redirect to others who are doing the real work.

## 5. STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALIGNMENT
Pressure-Test the Narrative Before It Ships
Offer him the pre-launch memo, not the post-launch tweet. “What breaks here?” is an ask he
welcomes.
## Let Him Build Public Legitimacy
He has real platforms — podcasts, students, tech networks, media channels. If you give him
something he believes in, he’ll carry it. Not as a favor. As an obligation.
Show How the Model Helps People Exit the Box They’re Trapped In
Whether it’s an algorithm that auto-denies benefits or a workplace that punishes honesty, he
wants to know: does your intervention make someone’s life freer?
Use His Voice to Surface Urgency Without Drama
He speaks fluently in boardroom, classroom, newsroom. He can help say “This is not alarmism
— this is architecture.” Let him help frame your stakes for the rooms you can’t yet get into.


## 6. TACTICAL APPROACH TO THE MEETING
Lead With the Contradiction, Not the Vision
Say: “We built this to empower workers — but it’s being used by managers to silence them.
We’re trying to fix it.” That opens him up.
Don’t Over-Orient to His Resume
He’s a CEO emeritus who still writes code. Don’t over-formalize. Don’t undercut. Meet him
where he is — part builder, part strategist, part learner.
Make Time for Real Listening
If you only need a yes/no, email him. If you want help shaping the work, set up a meeting
where everyone can ask and answer hard questions.
Send the Follow-Up That Wants an Edit
Post-meeting, send the doc that says “Here’s where we still can’t get clarity — would you help
us think it through?” That’s where he’ll re-engage.

## 7. DINNER PARTY TEST
## Disengages Around:
Corporate talk about “shared value.” Startup talk about “blitzscaling.” Donor talk about “leading
the movement.” Any language that replaces structure with spin.
## Leans In When:
Someone says: “We did harm — and we’re still untangling it.” Or: “The workers wrote this
clause. It doesn’t match our theory. But it matches reality.”
Moves the Room With:
A hard lesson from Indeed. A broken trust moment from early recovery. A question about
whose incentives are rigged. A sentence that opens ethical ground without closing the door.
## Watches For:
Who slows down when things get uncomfortable. Who frames without flattening. Who listens
like stakes are real.


## DONOR PERSUASION PROFILE: YARI
## GREANEY
Context: DTW → Yari → Siena

## 1. DONOR IDENTITY & BACKGROUND
Movement-Born, Justice-Formed Operator
Yari Greaney grew up in Northern California in a science-oriented family (botany, birding,
outdoor ecology). Her formative exposure was not elite philanthropy but fire-scorched
landscapes, water justice issues, and early climate realities. This gave her a lifelong
understanding that environmental harm and social harm are inseparable.
Organized Before She Ever Worked in Philanthropy
She built her identity through campaigns: Fossil Free Stanford (scaled from 5 people to
thousands), housing justice and climate coalitions in D.C., water governance research in
Uganda, the DC ReInvest coalition targeting Wells Fargo, opposition to the Potomac Pipeline,
and movement work with 350.org. She is not someone who “found movements.” She was
formed by them.
Inside–Outside Strategist
She has spent years inside government (D.C. Deputy Mayor’s Office for Planning & Economic
Development), years inside campaigns (Bernie 2020), and years inside data and research
shops (Climate Advocacy Lab). She understands institutional constraints, policy timelines, and
what it takes to turn mobilization into governance.
Family Office Philanthropy, Without the Family Office Posture
As Program Manager for Local Politics & Environmental Justice at Preston-Werner Ventures,
she stewards the philanthropic and political investments of a major tech family. But she does not
present as “philanthropy staff.” She frames her role as moving resources toward movements
that are materially shifting power. She brings organizer instincts into donor rooms and donor
leverage into organizer spaces.
Left Political Identity, Public and Unambiguous
She has been a co-chair of East Bay DSA. She organizes with Bay Area Labor for Palestine.
She partners with corporate-free political alliances like the Richmond Progressive Alliance. Her
politics are not “progressive-ish”; they are structurally left. That matters not because she needs
ideological mirroring, but because she screens for seriousness about power.


## 2. CORE MOTIVATIONS, VALUES, AND TRIGGERS
## Power Shifts Over Policy Wins
She measures success by whether power moves from elites to communities — workers,
tenants, youth, BIPOC neighborhoods. A project with impressive outputs but unchanged power
dynamics will not register as meaningful.
Frontline Leadership as Non-Negotiable
She is motivated by work authored by those most affected. If the intervention is designed or
governed by impacted communities, she sees it as credible. If they are downstream or symbolic
participants, she senses misalignment.
Place-Specific Analysis
She trusts people who know the terrain: the housing code, the zoning corridor, the wildfire map,
the ward-level political dynamics. She responds strongly to organizers who can name how the
issue shows up locally — Richmond, Oakland, DC Ward 7, etc.
Anti-Corporate, Pro-Community Orientation
She is animated by efforts that curb corporate extraction and expand democratic control. She
responds to frames about community ownership, cooperative governance, democratic
workplaces, anti-monopoly strategy, and public accountability of utilities and tech giants.
## Climate + Economic + Racial Justice Interlock
She does not silo issues. If you show how labor rights strengthen climate resilience, or how
tenant organizing intersects with racial justice, or how worker power disrupts authoritarian drift,
you are speaking her conceptual grammar.

## 3. IDEAL ENGAGEMENT STYLE
Bring the Real Tension, Not the Polished Story
She prefers hearing: “Here’s the contradiction we haven’t resolved,” over “Here’s the narrative
we’re excited about.” She trusts conflict more than consensus.
Model the Governance, Not Just the Vision
She wants to understand: Who decides? Who benefits? What recourse do people have? She
engages more when decision rights are clear than when narratives are aspirational.
Participatory Texture in the Meeting
She watches how you run the room. If it mirrors extractive patterns — one voice dominates,
communities are referenced but not present — she reads that as indicative of the work.
Bias to Practical Action
She appreciates specificity: “We want to increase worker density in this sector, in these initial

geographies, through these intermediary structures.” Vagueness signals lack of spine, not lack
of polish.
Not Moved by Prestige, Only by Alignment
Institutional credibility, brand strength, or celebrity endorsements do not impress her.
Demonstrated alignment with impacted communities does.

## 4. CHALLENGES & RISK FACTORS
Rupture Cue: Community as Ornament
If presented with a model where communities are consulted but not governing, or centered
rhetorically but sidelined structurally, she will quietly withdraw. She will not attack — she will
pivot to listening mode.
Misreading Her as a “Tech Philanthropy Professional”
She is an organizer operating inside philanthropy, not a philanthropy professional who once
organized. If you talk to her as though she represents a neutral grantmaking apparatus, you will
misread her entirely.
Over-Moderate Framing
If the pitch sanitizes conflict or softens claims about corporate exploitation, climate injustice, or
worker suppression, she interprets it as lack of political clarity.
Too Much Emphasis on Policy Without Power
She has seen tech, climate, and housing policies die on the vine because the power wasn’t
there. If you lead with policy instead of power-building, she will not believe the theory of change
is real.
Cynicism or Fatalism
She does not align with projects that treat conditions as fixed. She believes movement power
can win — she has done it repeatedly. If you frame the work defensively (“We’re trying to hold
the line”), she will sense misalignment.

## 5. STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALIGNMENT
Position DTW as Power Infrastructure, Not Advocacy
Show that you are building worker power as a long-term civic foundation, not as short-cycle
issue advocacy. She responds to organizations with a base, not organizations with “initiatives.”

Connect Worker Power to Climate and Housing Justice
Demonstrate how labor density and organizing change conditions on the ground: wildfire
resilience, green job access, housing stability, anti-displacement. She is wired to see
cross-issue consequences.
## Emphasize Community Governance
If workers co-design or co-govern the model, highlight it early. That signals credibility for her
values and her philanthropic role.
Provide a Clear Path to Local Wins
She appreciates specificity about city-level and county-level pathways — charter changes,
labor ordinances, budget fights, governance experiments. She funds and believes in local
victories.
Invite Her Into the Strategic Question, Not the Public Narrative
She excels at shaping the hard part: “How do we build durable political formations around
worker power in places where the base is thin?” Ask her that.

## 6. TACTICAL APPROACH TO THE MEETING
Lead With the Structural Stakes
Open with: “We believe worker power is the primary bulwark against authoritarianism and
economic extraction. Here’s where the leverage is.” That frames the conversation at her altitude.
Anchor in One Real Example
Use a specific worker campaign, a specific city, a specific employer, or a specific political fight
— not generalities. Grounding builds trust.
## Show Where You’re Still Uncertain
Share the edge of your learning: “We’re not sure if this organizing model will scale in
low-density labor markets,” or “We’re debating whether to prioritize city-level or sector-level
entry points.”
Avoid the Hard Sell
She does not like being “pitched to.” She prefers being engaged as a strategic peer. Treat the
meeting as a joint analysis session, not a funnel.
Describe the Community Relationships as They Actually Are
Not idealized. Not airbrushed. State who you’re accountable to, how you built those
relationships, and where the tensions live.


## 7. DINNER PARTY TEST
## Disengages Around:
Philanthropic platitudes. Tech-savior logic. Incrementalist climate talk. Euphemisms about
“stakeholders” instead of naming power. Appeals to “both sides.” Anything decontextualized
from race, class, or geography.
## Leans In When:
Someone says: “Here’s how this employer retaliates and how workers are beating it.”
Or: “This city budget line is where extraction hides.”
Or: “We didn’t get this right the first time, and here’s what we changed when organizers pushed
us.”
Moves the Room With:
A grounded example from Richmond or D.C.
A cross-issue insight (“This housing fight is a climate fight.”)
A question that forces clarity (“Who actually holds power in this decision and how do workers
get into that equation?”)
## Watches For:
Who understands local political ecosystems.
Who treats community as authors, not audiences.
Who names power plainly and maps it accurately.
