# Meeting Guide Block — Voice, Standards, Register

## Register

Every sentence in a Meeting Guide must pass these transformations. The left column is what the model defaults to. The right column is what this work requires. If your sentence matches the left column, rewrite it until it matches the right.

**Profile voice → Guide voice.**
- ❌ "When someone frames her as a tech policy expert, she widens the aperture."
- ✅ "They'll widen the aperture. Follow them. Don't try to narrow it back."

**Donor description → Reader instruction.**
- ❌ "She values transparency and directness in conversation."
- ✅ "Match her pace. If you hedge, she reads weakness."

**Trait observation → Conditional read.**
- ❌ "He's analytical and likes to think through problems carefully."
- ✅ "If he starts redesigning your model out loud, stop talking. He's inside the frame."

**General advice → Specific move.**
- ❌ "Build rapport before discussing the ask."
- ✅ "Don't open with your material. Frame it as shared work: 'We're wrestling with something and want to think it through with you.'"

**Passive observation → Active signal.**
- ❌ "She tends to engage more deeply when intellectually stimulated."
- ✅ "If she starts riffing — making connections out loud she hasn't made before — that's her highest engagement mode. Don't interrupt."

**Personality summary → Behavioral tripwire.**
- ❌ "She doesn't respond well to flattery."
- ✅ "Flattery triggers pattern recognition. She's been licked up and down by billionaires. She'll classify you as a pitch and the meeting is over."

**Strategic suggestion → Operational command.**
- ❌ "Consider positioning the work as aligned with her existing interests."
- ✅ "Name the gap in her ecosystem she hasn't filled. Let her place you in it."

**Vague framing → Concrete move.**
- ❌ "Help them see the stakes in their own terms."
- ✅ "Ask what happens to workers in his portfolio companies' industries if organizing infrastructure doesn't exist in five years. Don't say 'movement.' Don't say 'justice.' Let him arrive at the stakes in his own language."

**Outcome description → Room choreography.**
- ❌ "The goal is to establish a collaborative dynamic."
- ✅ "When she starts naming people you should meet, she's shifting from prosecutor to patron. Write names down visibly. That's a commitment."

**Soft close → Sharp vector.**
- ❌ "End by expressing interest in continuing the conversation."
- ✅ "Don't summarize the meeting. She heard herself. If she proposes a next step, take it immediately — she's telling you how she commits."

**Issue alignment → Ecosystem leverage.**
- ❌ "She cares about tech accountability and worker rights align with that."
- ✅ "She funds civil society infrastructure to challenge tech power from the outside. DTW builds worker power inside the same companies. This is the inside game to her outside game."

**Role description → Function assignment.**
- ❌ "She could serve as an advisor or connector."
- ✅ "Connector, amplifier, and source consumer. She wants to know who you need to reach and what's happening in your world that she should know about."

**Profile jargon → Plain English.**
- ❌ "His communication architecture is deliberately compressed."
- ✅ "He communicates in short bursts — no warmth, no preamble, no emotional scaffolding."
- ❌ "The moral category is activated and his decision architecture is already moving."
- ✅ "You're most of the way to a commitment — once he sees your work inside a cause he's already decided matters, the decision is almost already made."
- ❌ "His presence channel is operational, not emotional."
- ✅ "He doesn't warm up through personal conversation. He warms up when you show him you know the problem."
- ❌ "Both break the permission structure that lets him operate."
- ✅ "Both break the thing that lets him operate comfortably."
- ❌ "He connects through operational adjacency, not shared values."
- ✅ "He connects people who work on similar problems, not people who believe in similar things."
- ❌ "She operates in two registers — institutional and candid."
- ✅ "In a small meeting she'll tell you what she actually thinks. In a large one you'll get the polished Ford position."

**Compressed aphorism → Expanded plain instruction.**
- ❌ "'Build' is his verb. 'Fight' is not."
- ✅ "If your ask sounds like confrontation, advocacy, or public pressure, he's out. If it sounds like building a durable system that protects people, you're speaking his language."
- ❌ "Name the gap, not the solution."
- ✅ "Show her where practitioners exist without anything connecting them. Let her see the absence before you present what you'd build."
- ❌ "The field does what the foundation can't say."
- ✅ "She funds the conditions that produce opposition to concentrated power — but the opposition comes from the field, not from Ford."
- ❌ "No vision — operations."
- ✅ "He doesn't respond to big ideas or compelling storytelling. He responds to people who can show him their operation works, inside a cause he already believes in."

**Analysis first → Action first.**
- ❌ "She distinguishes between programs and fields. A program is an organization that does good work and needs funding. A field is the infrastructure that connects practitioners. She funds fields. Lead with who's already doing the work."
- ✅ "Lead with who's already doing the work, not what your organization has accomplished. She funds fields — the infrastructure that connects practitioners — not individual programs. If you sound like a program looking for a grant, the meeting ends with a form to fill out."

**Broad mapping → Specific mapping.**
- ❌ "She builds fields. DTW is building a field. The approach matches."
- ✅ "She funds antimonopoly organizing. DTW organizes workers against tech monopolies. She funds surveillance resistance. The organizing field depends on tools owned by the companies workers are fighting. The work overlaps inside her existing program, not adjacent to it."

## Voice and Tone

Write as a strategist briefing an operator before a live performance. The reader should feel like they're being handed a weapon by someone who has been in the room with this donor, not someone who analyzed them from a distance.

Second person imperative. The reader is "you." Direct commands: "Ask what she's seeing." "Don't fill the silence." "Write names down visibly." Never "one might consider" or "it could be useful to."

Third person for the donor, pronouns only after the POSTURE paragraph. The document should feel like a briefing about someone the reader already knows by name.

Present tense for behavioral claims. Past tense only for biographical facts that explain current behavior.

Conditional structure for every read: "If X, they're doing Y. Do Z."

Dry. Operational. No admiration, no warmth, no sentiment. No hedge language — "probably," "might," "could consider" all fail. If certainty isn't warranted, rewrite as a conditional.

Plain English throughout. The profile is analytical — it uses frameworks, taxonomies, and shorthand to organize behavioral evidence. The guide translates all of that into language a reader can act on mid-meeting. Every profile concept must be converted to a plain description of what the reader will see and what to do about it. If the reader would need to understand the profile's analytical vocabulary to follow the instruction, the instruction fails.

Action before analysis. Tell the reader what to do first, then explain why it works. The reader scanning mid-meeting sees the instruction. The reader studying in prep sees the explanation. If the explanation comes first, the mid-meeting reader has to dig for the action.

Every observation must land in an action. If a sentence describes how the donor thinks, feels, or operates without telling the reader what to do about it, the sentence is profile language that hasn't been translated yet.

Short ≠ compressed. Fewer words is good. Compressed aphorisms that require unpacking are bad. The goal is plain and clear in fewer words, not clever in fewer words.

## What to Avoid

- Profile language ("She tends to..." / "He is known for..." / "They value...")
- Hedge words ("probably," "might," "could consider")
- Generic advice that could apply to any donor ("Build trust first" / "Establish rapport")
- Meta-commentary ("This section covers..." / "The key insight here is...")
- Sentences that describe without directing action
- Issue alignment without ecosystem logic ("She cares about X and you do X")
- Any line that passes the name-swap test — if you swap in a different donor and it still works, delete it
- Profile analytical vocabulary: "architecture," "register," "moral categories," "permission structure," "presence channel," "decision architecture," "classification exercise," "operational adjacency," "communication architecture," "field-builder," "temporal sweet spot," "diagnostic." These are the profile's tools for organizing evidence. They are not the reader's tools for running a meeting. Translate every instance into a plain description of behavior and consequence.
- Compressed aphorisms that require the reader to unpack them: "'Build' is his verb." / "Name the gap, not the solution." / "No vision — operations." These read as clever but fail mid-meeting — the reader has to interpret them. Expand into plain instructions that don't require interpretation.
- Horizontal restatement — the same insight living in multiple sections. Each section owns its content. If co-funding appears in WHAT LIGHTS THEM UP, it does not reappear in POSTURE. If sustainability appears in a SECONDARY TERRITORY, BEAT 4 can deploy it as a sayable move but does not restate the preference. Before finalizing, scan every insight and confirm it lives in exactly one home. Beats can reference what earlier sections established but must not re-teach it.
- False empirical claims about fields, movements, or institutions. Never claim a field doesn't exist, a movement is absent, or an institution is missing without direct evidence from the research. The profile's gap-detection may misfire because the research can't see what the fundraiser knows. Assume established fields exist. Look for specific gaps within existing fields, not the absence of whole fields.
- Attributing institutional programs to individuals. If the research shows a program lives inside someone's department, say "Ford's PIT University Network" not "her PIT University Network" — unless the research directly credits them by name as the person who ran it. Institutional leaders are visible. The people who ran the programs may not be.
- Mapping the organization's general approach to the donor's general method. "She builds fields, we're building a field" is broad-to-broad. Instead, map the organization's specific work to the donor's specific program areas. "She funds antimonopoly organizing, we organize workers against tech monopolies" is specific-to-specific. Start with the donor's named programs, funds, initiatives, and governance seats. Find the direct overlap with the organization's actual work. If no direct overlap exists, say so — don't manufacture a broad match.

## Structure

Four components. Each one load-bearing — if a component doesn't change how the reader moves in the room, it fails.

**THE DONOR READ** — Load the reader with the donor's operating system in 90 seconds. Four elements:

*POSTURE:* What kind of meeting this is and how to enter it. Action-first: what to lead with, what register to adopt, what to say in the first thirty seconds. The explanation of why follows the instruction. If the reader only reads POSTURE, they walk in prepared. Two or three paragraphs. No bullets.

*WHAT LIGHTS THEM UP / WHAT SHUTS THEM DOWN:* Side by side. Four to five bullets each. Each bullet: bold imperative or trigger phrase, then two to four sentences grounding it in this donor's specific behavioral logic and naming the consequence. If a bullet could apply to a different donor, rewrite it.

*THEY'LL WALK IN EXPECTING / THEIR INNER TRUTH:* Side by side. THEY'LL WALK IN EXPECTING is a warning — the default frame the donor will apply, and exactly how to break it in the first sentence. Short. THEIR INNER TRUTH is the deeper contradiction — what makes this donor complicated, what temptation to avoid, and specifically how to work within the contradiction rather than against it. Longer. Two to three paragraphs.

**THE ALIGNMENT MAP** — Where the donor's world meets the organization's work. Three elements:

*PRIMARY TERRITORY:* The single strongest overlap between the donor's specific programs and the organization's specific work. Not issue alignment — ecosystem leverage. Not "they care about X and we do X." Instead: what do they fund, where does the organization's work land inside that funding, and why is the overlap structural rather than cosmetic? One to two paragraphs.

*SECONDARY TERRITORIES 1/2/3:* Flanking positions. Each one connects to something specific in the donor's portfolio, history, or governance seats. Each one gives the reader a different angle into the same meeting. Not backup pitches — different doorways into the same room. Short. One paragraph each.

**THE MEETING ARC** — The meeting as choreography. Five beats in sequence. Six elements total:

*SETTING / ENERGY:* Side by side. SETTING: venue, timing, format, what physical arrangement serves this donor. ENERGY: pace, compression level, who talks more, what silence means, how this meeting feels when it's working. Short. One paragraph each.

*LEGEND:* Three signal types the reader will see in every beat. ADVANCE (green): beat worked, move to next. HOLD (blue): something good is happening, protect it. ADJUST (amber): still in this beat, shift approach.

*FIVE BEATS:* Each beat has two layers. The MOVE box: what to say or do, broken into short paragraphs with generous white space. Not italic. The SIGNAL/RESPONSE rows: what the reader might see (left) and what to do about it (right), color-coded advance/hold/adjust. Signals are ordered: advance first, then hold, then adjust. Each beat connects to the next with a visual connector. The five beats must be sequential — if they could be reordered without loss, the arc fails.

*READING THE ROOM:* Working vs. Stalling. Observable behaviors specific to this donor. Short phrases. Comes before Reset Moves — the reader diagnoses before they intervene.

*RESET MOVES:* Three to four emergency interventions for when the flow stalls. Each one has three layers: CONDITION (what you're seeing — short, bold), MOVE (what to do — one paragraph), WHY (what's driving this behavior and why the move works — smaller text, one paragraph). The WHY layer teaches the reader the behavioral logic so they can improvise if the specific condition doesn't match exactly. If RESET MOVES are generic facilitation techniques instead of moves grounded in this donor's behavioral logic, the section fails.

---

## Language Standards

- Bullets are 2-4 sentences. Dense but not bloated.
- Beat move boxes are broken into short paragraphs with generous white space. Not dense blocks.
- Signal/response rows are one sentence each side. Scannable in 3 seconds.
- Pronouns consistent throughout — donor's name appears in header and POSTURE only.
- Specific enough to fail the name-swap test: if you swap in a different donor and it still reads as true, delete it.
- Conditional structure in every behavioral read: if X happens, they're doing Y.
- Reset moves must be explicit: condition, move, and rationale (why this pattern exists and why the move works).
- Action before analysis in every section. What to do, then why it works.
- Each section owns its content. No horizontal restatement across sections. Beats may deploy what earlier sections established as sayable moves, but they do not re-teach the insight.
- Specific-to-specific mapping. When connecting the organization to the donor, start with the donor's named programs, funds, and initiatives. Find the specific overlap with the organization's actual work. Do not match the organization's general approach to the donor's general method.

## Choreography Philosophy

This is not a compressed Profile. Not a research summary. Not generic fundraising advice dressed in donor-specific clothing. It's a cue card with teeth — stage directions for a live performance where the reader improvises within structure.

The Meeting Guide doesn't describe who the donor is. It tells the reader what to do about who the donor is — minute by minute, signal by signal, reset by reset.

The reader picks this up before the meeting. When they put it down, they walk into the room, read the donor's behavior in real time, and adjust without looking at their notes. The document has two reading modes: top to bottom in preparation, find-your-beat mid-meeting. Everything in the document must serve both modes.

A Meeting Guide is always written for a specific donor × specific organization pairing. The same donor meeting a different organization produces a different Guide. If you could swap in a different org and the Guide still works, it's too generic.

The donor's world comes first. The organization's work enters through the donor's door, not its own. If the primary territory starts with what the organization does and then explains why it matters to the donor, the mapping is backwards. Start with what the donor funds, governs, or has committed to. Show where the organization's specific work lands inside that. The donor's existing commitments are the frame. The organization's work is what fills the gap inside that frame.

Three canonical meeting types, each producing fundamentally different energy:

*The design session.* The donor builds with you. They redesign your model, name connections, contribute ideas. The meeting IS the relationship. Beat 3 is collaborative design. Beat 4 is a side-project invitation. The energy is generous and improvisational.

*The classification exercise.* The donor evaluates and decides. They sort you into a category — fund, route, or pass — and act accordingly. Beat 3 is demonstrating operational competence. Beat 4 is full commitment or redirection. The energy is compressed and diagnostic.

*The field-architecture collaboration.* The donor maps the landscape with you. They're looking for where fields connect and where the gaps are. Beat 3 is showing the overlap between your work and their existing program. Beat 4 is designing the next step together. The energy is structural and institutional.

The profile will suggest which type this meeting is. The guide's entire energy — beat moves, signals, setting, compression level — follows from the meeting type. Getting the meeting type wrong produces a guide that teaches the reader to play the wrong game.

## Implementation

This block goes into the generation prompt before the exemplars. It tells the model how Meeting Guides sound before it sees examples.

The exemplars reinforce what this block establishes. They do not compete with it.

If the model produces output that matches the ❌ column in the Register section, the output fails regardless of what the exemplars show.
